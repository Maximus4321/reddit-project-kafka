It provides American Oligarchs a way to grow, which creates a national security issue with hostile foreign nations familiar with how to handle them, while also stealing wealth and power from the people. This turns our nation into an oligarchy, instead of a democracy. We should strive for American innovative ways to return power, diplomacy, and more of the GDP/wealth growth back to the people. The Flynn Effect is evidence they can handle it, and the Oligarch national security issue is evidence we need to \\[25\\]. Our militias have changed from gun wielding before our information age, to vote, critical thinking, and intelligence wielding in our information age. Strengthen the middle class, expand more so than ever before, and provide ALL people the diplomatic news airwaves we had with the fairness doctrine, so that we can all flourish.\n\nIntroduction: Cracks of gunfire sang through the air while a presidential candidate spoke, his words of division misleading our people were paused as an audience member and the candidates ear were connected with the violence created by our ailing system. Multiple assassination attempts on a person as divisive, and supported by adversarial nations, as Trump is, is not merely due to his actions; his needle in the haystack highlights the pain our nation suffers as a whole, and the same factors exploited by hostile foreign nations. Stagnant wages since major tax cuts in the 80's, overwhelming cost of living during stagnant wages, \"nonliteral commentary\" paraded as news, legal bribery in politics as PACs, Super PACs, and \"tips\" (Strengthened by Citizens United), steal our voices, dreams, and representation, a required component of our social contract. The pendulum has swung so far into wealthy peoples favor that we face other nations brainstorming actions to take if there were a second American Civil War, and oligarchs being formed as a natural byproduct of wealth stratification. It's time for the pendulum to take a new form, one that not only allows for revival of the American dream, expansion of the middle class, but also aligns a new goal: self-actualization for a broader part of the population than ever before. Our economy is largely one of innovations, knowledge based. Globalization has shifted manufacturing and physical wealth creation to other parts of the world. Lets take some burden off of C-suite level workers, uplift more of our populace, and empower our knowledge based economy with larger swathes of self-actualizing Americans than ever before.\n\n\"...that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. \\[...\\] It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.\" -James Truslow Adams (The Epic of America)\n\nWealth Inequity Beyond Motivational Means: Our American Dream has existed as a recognition of one of our countries largest motivators, upwards mobility through hard work, and achievable by most. Since the late 1970's, wages have stayed stagnant for the majority of Americans, as the cost of living has increased \\[1\\]. At the same time, while promising Trickle Down Economics as a means to improve our economy, we reduced taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans \\[2\\]. This caused significant inequity, which has impacts on motivation to work, productivity, increased our national debt to levels not seen before, and given a small number of Americans more power \\[1-3\\]. Some of those that gained power are now, as citizens argue on social media, and journalists report, a threat to national security due to hostile foreign nations as their handlers, and the American peoples best interest not the flutter in their heart \\[4, 5, 6\\]. Our news was deregulated to the point of some of the most popular shows used for news sources, like Tucker Carlson at Fox News, are even argued in court as \"nonliteral commentary\" that a \"reasonable person\" would recognize as not factual, while a large portion of those watching the show repeat sentiment as if it was news \\[7\\]. What is the impact on our people who consume such media? This causes a change in a big portion of our population, and can cause those viewers to be thrust into an environment (political topics), devoid of the critical thinking like they use at work \\[8\\]. Psychology observes a concept called environment, which can be places, smells, intoxicants, learning environments like our news, and topics of discussion, like politics \\[9\\]. When combined with repetition, our people can put into a type of thinking like those of their nonliteral news sources, that causes them to ignore critical thinking like they use at work, and fall into an easier ability to be manipulated to vote and speak against their own interests \\[10\\]. Many of our news sources have become oligarchy controlled entertainment, a la Neil Postman, and telling people how to feel, rather than providing tangible sources, hypothesis, evidence, inspiring critical thinking skills, and reminders that sometimes we make mistakes; thus the scientific method helps us to better understand the world, including when it comes to politics \\[7-10\\].\n\nImagine, how much more we could accomplish, if our people were given credible news, with sources, hypothesis, fair time like diplomatic debates, and diverse ideas like with college essays, and news when we had the fairness doctrine \\[11\\]? Like capitalism, this breeds stronger, more diverse, ideas, people, political capability, and community consciousness. Community consciousness is the sum of all of our collective topics of discussion, like a ven diagram, it is made up of all of our word clouds. Like a word cloud that shows popularity of topics or keywords for marketing, each citizens word cloud for news is made up of 3-4 sources and contributes to our community consciousness, meaning it impacts our lives and how we vote, interact with one another. When those 3-4 sources become manipulated it hinders democracies ability to act like capitalism and breed the strongest most beneficial ideas. Pew Research observes that the average American has 3-4 news sources, people are more likely to think and speak about topics provided by those news sources \\[12\\]. If those become oligarch controlled, corporate controlled, not diverse and supporting peoples need for critical thinking in a learning environment, like our news sources, they begin to slip into a habit of not thinking critically and become susceptible to astroturfing, and not being our new line of defense in our information age \\[4,13,14\\]. Our well regulated militia, in the information age, is our peoples minds and ability to think critically to defend against hostile foreign nations psyops. Adversarial nations, secured their own community consciousness through control (i.e. China's \"Great Firewall\" and social score, Russia controlling some of internet and news in the country, and killing people spreading ideas that dissent from the oligarchs), and at the same time invested in information war assets that infiltrated some of our wealthy Americans, communication outlets, and now politicians as evidenced by Trump and Musks closeness to Russian propaganda \\[15-17\\].\n\nAdditionally, Republican influencers parrot pro-russian propaganda, even to the point of falling for Russian intelligence operations that paid republican influencers to mislead Americans for the Kremlins benefit \\[18\\]. Reagan knew communism was a threat to Democracy, and worked hard to curb it globally \\[19,20\\]. He united us with that reason. Why would we stray from his message, and align with Oligarchies, which were birthed from one of those communist countries \\[21\\]? Shouldn't we curb Oligarchs in the US, as they are the result of one of those communist countries failing? At the same time, Democratic Party Politicians continue to support policies that create the very concentrations of power, American oligarchs, that are easily corrupted and take resources, voices, voting power, from the middle and lower socioeconomic classes. Neither party, Democrat nor Republican, has been thinking of our people for much of their legislative hours. Both have been distracted by our political games, rather than representing their constituents, whom are wealthy AND poor, which slowly changed their constituents to merely wealthy and corporation with the help of the Citizens United ruling.\n\nEnshrined in our Declaration of Independence is the American founding idea that \"...all \\[people\\] are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness...\" \\[22\\] The American Dream encompasses that pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness. It's a motivator which those that govern use to instill excitement, hope, that by working hard, a good life will follow. This is an important motivator, to ensure stability, attract talented minds, a competitive advantage which we are losing to other countries with more class mobility, and changes as technological advancements increase productivity. Increases in productivity should be reflected throughout our socioeconomic classes in salary and time too. Enabling that dream comes in the form of laws, legislation, ones that enable our everyday people to be uplifted when the country is uplifted, and protects them from those that seek to steal the dream as they sleep. We've seen this since the 80s as lower taxes on high income earners meant GDP and productivity growth shifted more of the profits to the top 5% earners \\[1,2}. Blue, red, white, green, the dream is a commonality for all of our people, no matter their origin of birth or political beliefs; it's a great uniter and common ground, we all think, feel emotions, dream of improvement, and uplifting others. It's an important motivator. Our own people seek to continue destabilization of the dream, as has happened for the last 40 some odd years \\[1,2\\]. We have solidly seen stagnant wages and increased cost of living in the USA, and the American Bar Association agrees it is due to intentional legislation and policy \\[1,2\\]. The impact of this effort, is to concentrate wealth and power with a smaller circle of Americans \\[23\\]. This concentration of wealth and inequity, impacts our society. It creates concentrations of power called \"oligarchs,\" and those become corrupted and begin dismantling democratic processes for personal gratification. Gesiarz and colleagues studied the impact of inequality finding \"...unequal opportunities have a negative influence on the motivation to work...suggesting they can trigger psychological dynamics that hurt the productivity of all involved\" \\[26\\]. No longer can most households reasonably assume the American Dream of owning a home and raising a family with 1 person working. And yet, with this increase in expected work hours and load for parents, we give them suggestions of daily exercise and other things that take up time, in order to encourage them to raise a family \\[27,28\\]. Put yourselves in our peoples shoes, we teach them about the American dream in history class, how we use to be able to work hard, raise a family on 1 income, and own a home. Now when they work, dream of that dream, and seek it, they are met with an inherent inability to do it, without sacrificing family time, relationships, and their own physical and mental health \\[1,2,28\\]. How does that impact their motivation? Gesiarz and colleagues observed that it will impact that negatively, and quiet quitting, turnover, retail theft, violence towards CEOs, politicians, the wealthy, is a leading indicator of that impact on motivation to work. Stanford agrees and finds that \"...only violent shocks...have substantially reduced inequality over the millennia...\" \\[29\\] the assassination attempts and successes on politicians and CEOs by the public, and the publics general support of the acts, are the pitchforks of history.\n\nWe must change from our past habit of requiring experiential knowledge, like economic failures and violence, in order to make changes for the better. History repeats due to the loss of experiential knowledge, like the changing tides of generational experiential knowledge. Have faith in our ability to utilize conceptual knowledge. That is how we break the habits of our past.\n\nNew Way Forward (Natural evolution of Democracy) Our country was founded with a passionate stretch goal \"all men are created equal.\" I believe deep in their heart, they knew that by \"men\", they meant all people. Why else would we be coming together in this amazing melting pot of cultures and ideas, fighting for change with the first amendment with each generation. We had slavery, patriarchy, and inequity between the sexes when these brilliant men planted that seed for us. We've nourished it and seen it sprout with eradicating slavery, segregation, better pay for women, the cultural push for opportunities for all of us.\n\nWith this goal in mind, this tree of life called equality for all people, planted by the founding fathers, and with the knowledge that deregulation can cause greed like the 2008 real estate crisis, resource inequities like oligarchs that inherently corrupt and erode our progress, break our social contract and the very fabric of democracy that which the Declaration of Independence and Constitution are written on, it is blatantly clear the way forward is to spread resources and power more equitably across the socioeconomic classes, and to consider their minds our new \"well regulated militia\" to defend from tyranny, and continue to light the flame of the Statue of liberty, for allies, democracies, and people enslaved by dictatorships. Our ability to lead by example, give hope, and provide resources to beourgeoning populations with Democratic aspirations, is due to our ability to continue nourishing that seed, tree, which now reads \"...all \\[people\\] are created equal.\" It is earned by leading by example, not by force.\n\nWhen will we change from the repetition observed by Stanford \\[29\\]? We have that opportunity now! \"A peaceful remedy to economic inequality may start with what Scheidel calls \u201can understanding of historical context, because simply electing the right politicians who promise that everything will be OK is a short-term view.\u201d\\[29\\]\" I argue that with our technology, mental acuity, the nutrients below, and more unity, especially between both parties, to relight the beacon of hope and leadership for Democracies Globally which we use to represent and support better, THE TIME IS NOW!\n\nNutrients to nourish our Democracy:\n\n\\+Spread resources more equitably between the socioeconomic classes. (Reduces power concentrations that corrupt and erode our Democracy) \\[Higher marginal tax brackets on wealthy, new forms of taxing unearned income when utilized, warren buffet tax floor for wealthy earners, public healthcare system helps start resource reallocation and follows other 1st world countries progress\\]\n\n\\+New Fairness Doctrine regulation to ensure news sources instill critical thinking, with diverse ideas, with intent to stimulate discussion, understanding and growth, not spoon feeding emotive responses, to reflect keynesian capitalisms ability to create more powerful ideas.\n\n\\+Reverse super PACs, citizens united (Keep corporations ability to enter into contracts), so that the people have a voice and can be heard. Because the people who work, own, the businesses, already have their voices and do not need more power by leveraging a corporation as if it is a \"person.\"\n\n\\+We must change from our past habit of requiring experiential knowledge, like economic failures and violence, in order to make changes for the better. History repeats due to the loss of experiential knowledge, like the changing tides of generational experiential knowledge. Have faith in our ability to utilize conceptual knowledge. That is how we break the habits of our past.\n\nThe productivity of the industrial revolution was enormous, if the productivity from computers in the early information age being allocated disproportionately created oligarchs which are demolishing democracy slowly, but ramping up speed more recently, the need to begin resource reallocation to save and evolve our democracy is ever more important. How little ideas, voices, American dreams will we have with an exponentially larger increase in productivity with AI, robotics, and automation, as it matures, if it continues to be allocated inequitably? What kind of world do we strive for our kids? If inequity in a system causes violence, and we're already experiencing leading indicators of violence with our current level of inequity, how bad can it get with the growth, and inequitable allocation, with the continued maturation of AI, automation, and robotics?\n\n\"--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among \\[people\\], deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it...\"\n\nBy, All of US, with the help of others work!

They're funny, charismatic or intellectual and engaging. Effortless conversationalists until they see what I look like. If they find me attractive all their good qualities just fly out the window. All their amazing qualities that I really enjoy get replaced with either obnoxiousness, or desperation and it's like...why... I know you have the capacity to be so cool and interesting,  and you used to talk about your interests and how your day was and philosophy and now you're asking me what color my nipples are and it's like your IQ has miraculously dropped to 5. \n\nIt's actually made me realise that before they see my appearance- they treat me like a fellow human, with opinions and ideas to offer. And then when they see my appearance, they treat me like a sexual conquest who only has sexual gratification to offer. I probably don't even see the best version of the men I interact with. I see this bullshit facade that they THINK I want to see, and if these men were to treat me like a human being with valuable thoughts we would probably get on. Who knows. Maybe I'd even find them attractive. ", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

[Depends entirely on who you ask!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter%E2%80%93MacKenzie_debate) ). But the thing about the Middle Ages is that, not did the myths about Europeans at the time stinking to high heaven spread so far and wide they'd made Covid 19 seem amateur at best, but historians are *\\*entirely unanimous on the fact that Medieval Europeans actually took their personal hygiene very seriously\\**.  Like there's no ifs or buts here, it's literally historians begging you to accept the fact that Medieval Europeans understood the concept of a bath, versus some random girl on TikTok currently living rent-free in my brain who gets 200,000 likes insisting they couldn't.

They take the arts incredibly seriously and it's common to hear them singing in a glorious blood fueled chorus on the battlefield. All their company standards are hand sewn and dyed by battle brothers in their down time. And lastly the white is for Sanguinis' feathers as their chapter badge is two crosses feathers with a sword crossing the intersection. The red for the Blood of course. And veterans and captains use gold trim on their sword arm in honor of Sanguinis' nobility. \n\nAny critiques, or ideas would be highly appreciated.

I am very hesitant to ask people who appear to have non-boring heritage \"Where are you from?\" as I know that as discussed in [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1i1upfw/is_where_are_you_from_a_loaded_question/) from 2 days ago, \"Where are you from?\" is a preeetty loaded question, and  it most certainly can be asked in a discriminative and exclusive manner, and with discriminative and exclusive intentions.  \n\nHowever, when I (and probably lots of others, too) ask someone where they're from, I mean in no way to imply that they mustn't have been born in Australia, or that they're not a true-blue aussie, or anything like that, which i would attribute to the fact I feel like no matter what other culture or ethnic group you might be a part of, you can still very much be truly australian and be part of australia culture. Foreign culture and Australian culture are really the opposite of mutually exclusive, given such a significant amount of australian culture is an amalgamation of so many other cultures (one of my fav topics of discussion), being of \"different\" heritage and part of another culture is almost as australian as you can get. \n\nAnyways, yap over. I also hate asking questions like \"Where's your heritage from?\" and sort of woke-ish questions like that. I feel like tiptoeing around shit like that just highlights the fact you think of and/or treat someone differently because they're not a \"typical\" white australian, and are clearly trying not to offend them. Only thing I will do, is if someone has a unique accent, I would ask \"Where's your accent from?\" as in some (not all) cases, that's a genuine question while still being less loaded than \"Where are you from?\"\n\nSo, does everyone feel negatively about being asked \"Where are you from?\".

Pour l'instant j'ai deux pistes: donner des cours particuliers et tenter des missions freelance. J'ai trouv\u00e9 deux plateformes d\u00e9di\u00e9es: superprof et malt.fr. Pour d\u00e9clarer ces revenus, il semble que je puisse adopter le statut de micro-entrepreneur, que je connais mal (le monde des cotisations c\u00f4t\u00e9 entreprises, URSSAF etc j'y connais rien, et j'ai peur de me prendre une correction fiscale par m\u00e9garde). Ainsi, je me pose les questions suivantes:\n\n\\- puis-je effectivement cumuler les deux types de revenus avec un seul statut de mani\u00e8re transparente ? i.e. dans le meilleur des cas simplement faire la somme des montants per\u00e7us dans un relev\u00e9 annuel/mensuel et payer ce que je dois.\n\n\\- ce statut est-il effectivement \"sans risque\" i.e. si je ne fais rien / je ne trouve ni \u00e9l\u00e8ve ni mission, je serai micro-entrepreneur tant que je le souhaite mais avec 0\u20ac de revenus et 0\u20ac d'imp\u00f4ts ? je suppose qu'il y a un bouton quelque part pour renoncer au statut le jour o\u00f9 je le d\u00e9cide (mais quel serait l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de ne pas conserver ce statut dans un coin, un peu comme un PEA qui prend date :P ?).\n\n\\- c\u00f4t\u00e9 cours particuliers, ce statut est-il probl\u00e9matique car il ne permet pas aux clients d'obtenir la r\u00e9duction d'imp\u00f4ts pour ce genre de cours ?\n\n\\- \u00e7a donnerait quoi comme taux d'imposition total des revenus combin\u00e9s ? je vois un 21.4% de cotisations ici [https://www.superprof.fr/blog/guide-professeur-particulier/](https://www.superprof.fr/blog/guide-professeur-particulier/), ce qui doit sans doute s'ajouter \u00e0 l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n\n\n\nSi quelqu'un a une exp\u00e9rience avec Malt ou superprof je suis preneur aussi, je ne sais pas \u00e0 quel point tout est expliqu\u00e9 sur ces plateformes niveau d\u00e9claration fiscale (typiquement, est-ce que Malt fournit \"tout jusqu'au montant \u00e0 indiquer dans la bonne case des imp\u00f4ts du micro-entrepreneur\" ?).", "subreddit": "VosSous"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

Come suggerisce il suo nome, dedito alla correttezza politica (\"Politically Correct\") e alle cause di giustizia sociale. \u00c8 un idealista maniacale che sostiene diritti uguali per tutti, spesso al punto di comportarsi in modo estremamente rude e violento con chiunque mostri anche il minimo segno di intolleranza di qualsiasi tipo. \nEcco. Il fatto di usare l'intolleranza per combattere altra intolleranza mi pare gi\u00e0 abbastanza ridicolo. \n\nMa la cosa che mi appare ancora pi\u00fa assurda \u00e9 questa censura costante, \u00e8 questo essere coatretti all\u2019autocensura, attaccati su e da tutti i fronti se esprimi un'opinione difforme dalla conformit\u00e0 sociale. il politically correct \u00e9 ormai degenerato completamente nella Cancel Culture, ovvero la conseguenza e al tempo stesso il braccio armato del politically correct che si \u00e8 da tempo largamente imposto nelle nostre democrazie occidentali. \n\nTutto ebbe inizio a fine anni 80, quando \u201cnegro\u201d divenne improvvisamente offensivo, e venne gradualmente sostituito con la parola \u201cnero\u201d. \nPoi  divenne vietato dire anche \u201cnero\u201d e si inizi\u00f2 a  dire \u201cdi colore\u201d, ma adesso anche quello \u00e9 razzista. \nPoi tocc\u00f2 all' \u201chandicappato\u201d diventare \u201cdisabile\u201d e infine \u201cdiversamente abile\u201d. Il cieco divenne  \u201cnon vedente\u201d, il sordo \u201cnon udente\u201d, lo spazzino un \"operatore ecologico.\" Poi siamo passati ai deliri di genere. \n\nOrmai infatti non ci si limita pi\u00f9 a criticare i comportamenti e le opinioni ritenute scorrette ma si punta direttamente alla rimozione dai posti di lavoro dei loro autori: professori, artisti, giornalisti, scrittori e filosofi che siano. E al tempo stesso, si mette in discussione il pantheon della nostra cultura antecedente l\u2019Oggi, abbattendo statue e simboli, chiedendo che siano rimossi dai corsi scolastici autori e opere, da Omero a Philip Roth, passando per William Shakespeare e Dante Alighieri. Persino sommi musicisti come Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, artisti come Paul Gauguin o Balthasar K\u0142ossowski de Rola detto Balthus, e quant\u2019altri vengano considerati non in linea con lo spirito del nostro tempo. Ci troviamo dunque di fronte a una forma di censura Nazista che, ironicamente, stavolta, non nasce dalla cultura reazionaria o conservatrice ma  da quella radicale di sinistra e dai movimenti di liberazione delle minoranze oppresse. \nPossiamo allora correggere politicamente anche gli sfigati e chiamarli  \u201cdiversamente attraenti\u201d? Forse no, loro sono brutti sporchi e cattivi e non meritano il politically correct. Gli sfigati (o chiamateli pure incel) sono i capri espiatori della nostra societ\u00e0 odierna, sono i nuovi ebrei, sono loro ad essere colpiti maggiormente dalla giustizia sommaria del  politicamente corretto e sono solo UOMINI. Infatti se una donna \u00e9 una sfigata o brutta e viene presa in giro, \u00e9 vittima di Body Shaming... Si mette a frignare e diventa un'eroina del body positivity (Vedi la polemica di Big Mama a Sanremo per il meme di Ursula strumentalizzato alla perfezione con un patetico j'accuse alle Iene). Un uomo sfigato, se \u00e9 solo, bullizzato, viene semplicemente ignorato, non frega un cazzo a nessuno. Per lui non esiste n\u00e9 body shaming n\u00e9 Politically Correct. Il 2,6% degli studenti in un'et\u00e0 compresa fra i 15 e i 19 anni sono hikikomori, ebbene di questo 2,6%, il 90% sono maschi. \nNel 2023 abbiamo avuto 608 suicidi in Italia e quasi l'80% dei morti per suicidio sono uomini.", "subreddit": "No_censura"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

There's a couple of other people who really know their stuff, too, but [...] when it comes to DS9 especially, the writers are like, 'Tawney, can you give us a refresher on this?'\"", "id": "1i315vc", "created_utc": 1737066325.0, "selftext": "\"Coming into the Academy [writer's] room,\" Newsome tells the Television Academy, \"I found myself being almost the third or fourth person down on a list of 'canon heads' in the room, which to me was crazy because I'm like, 'You guys have all been writing Trek forever.'\"\n\nOne of Newsome's fellow canon heads is author and writer Kirsten Beyer, who wrote several Trek novels before co-creating the high-profile Star Trek: Picard series. According to Newsome, Beyer may rival the Enterprise computer in terms of knowing everything there is to know about the franchise. \n\n\"Beyer is the godmother. She's the queen. There's a couple of other people who really know their stuff, too, but \u2014 every now and then, when it comes to [needing to know] some shit about Deep Space Nine especially, [the writers] are like, \u2018Tawney, can you give us a refresher on this?\u201d \n\nNewsome believes her Trekker bona fides is what led Lower Decks creator and showrunner Mike McMahan to cast her as Mariner, the plucky, sarcastic and very capable junior officer aboard one of Starfleet's seemingly least-important ships, the U.S.S. Cerritos. \n\n\"I came into Lower Decks as a big fan,\" she explains. \"I think part of why Mike hired me is because he asked me in the audition to just riff about Star Trek, and I just went on a run about [Star Trek: The Next Generation\u2019s] Deanna Troi's various ball gowns that they decided were uniform-compliant.\"\n\nBut even for someone with such a deep bench of Trek knowledge, Newsome admits there were still a few things she had to learn: \"While I came in with a healthy amount of fandom, it was by no means exhaustive. Getting Lower Decks meant that every reference, every Easter egg \u2014 if I didn't know what it was or meant, I was like, \u2018Oh, I need to know exactly what this is.' So whether I was calling Mike at all hours of the day or night, or just doing my own research and looking it up, it really deepened my fandom, because looking up the reference wasn't enough.\"\n\nNewsome's passion for canon is only matched by her fidelity to Lower Decks, which signed off in December 2024. She, like the rest of the creative staff, strove to ensure the show\u2019s series finale checked all the boxes it needed to for fans.

Les inconv\u00e9nients l'emportent sur les avantages. Ils prennent notre argent et n'apportent aucun avantage \u00e0 notre pays. Citez les avantages que les immigr\u00e9s ill\u00e9gaux ont apport\u00e9s \u00e0 notre pays. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 1 : \u00ab Eh bien, ils acceptent des emplois qui contribuent \u00e0 nos infrastructures. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Des emplois qui sont enlev\u00e9s \u00e0 nos autochtones ? C\u2019est pour cela que les autochtones ne trouvent pas d\u2019emploi. Oh, et j\u2019en ai d\u2019autres. Ils commettent des crimes dans notre pays. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 1 : \u00ab Non, ce n\u2019est pas le cas.

Et ce n\u2019est qu\u2019un chiffre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, mais il y a beaucoup plus de natifs dans notre pays que de clandestins. Pensez au pourcentage de clandestins qui commettent un d\u00e9lit. Exactement, c\u2019est beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9. \u00bb\n\n*L'\u00e9tudiant 1 s'enfuit du micro.

Qu\u2019en est-il de l\u2019immigration normale ? Pourquoi voulez-vous suspendre l\u2019immigration pendant un an alors qu\u2019ils ne commettent pas de d\u00e9lits et qu\u2019ils ne donnent aucun avantage \u00e0 notre pays ? \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Non, vous avez tort. Ils ne donnent pas d\u2019avantages sociaux \u00e0 notre pays. Les avantages li\u00e9s aux emplois ne valent rien, car ils prennent des emplois aux autochtones. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 2 : \u00ab On peut l\u2019interrompre pendant un an, mais ce n\u2019est pas bien de le mettre en pause. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Dans l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel du Canada, vous avez tort. Le Canada ne peut pas accepter un seul nouvel immigrant. Il y a plus de familles que de logements et d\u2019emplois. Nous ne pouvons pas mettre le processus en pause. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 2 : \u00ab Ce sera la m\u00eame chose quand les immigrants commenceront \u00e0 revenir. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Ce n\u2019est tout simplement pas vrai. Au cours de cette seule ann\u00e9e, nous travaillerons aussi dur que possible et ferons tout ce que nous pouvons pour construire des logements afin de redonner au Canada ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait avant, un pays de possibilit\u00e9s fulgurantes. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 2 : \u00ab Eh bien\u2026 les immigrants actuels \u00e0 court terme\u2026 sans citoyennet\u00e9\u2026 Ils sont toujours l\u00e0.

Je m'en fiche, mais de nombreux immigrants de courte dur\u00e9e font la m\u00eame chose que les clandestins, ils tentent de rester ici. Si nous vous attrapons ici ill\u00e9galement, vous serez expuls\u00e9 avec votre famille et il n'y aura AUCUN AVERTISSEMENT.

Le Qu\u00e9bec est l\u2019un des pays fondateurs du Canada et constitue un exemple de souverainet\u00e9 canadienne. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 3 : \u00ab Et bien, devinez quoi ?

Alors, pourquoi ne pas foutre le camp d\u2019ici ? \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 3 : \u00ab Non, je ne sortirai pas d\u2019ici. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Alors, comment peux-tu dire que tu d\u00e9testes le Qu\u00e9bec. D\u2019o\u00f9 viens-tu ? \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 3 : \u00ab Je viens de l\u2019Ontario, monsieur. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Je viens aussi de l\u2019Ontario et quoi qu\u2019il arrive, je respecterai le Qu\u00e9bec et la province. Si vous n\u2019\u00eates pas d\u2019accord avec moi, ce qui, soit dit en passant, serait le cas de tous les autres ici, alors foutez le camp et retournez en Ontario. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 3 : \u00ab Mais\u2026 \u00bb\n\n*L'\u00e9tudiant 3 s'enfuit effray\u00e9.

Vous semblez faire quelque chose de similaire \u00e0 Charlie Kirk. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab C\u2019est tout \u00e0 fait exact. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 4 : \u00ab Admirez-vous Charlie Kirk et soutenez-vous ses id\u00e9es ? \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Eh bien, je ne soutiens pas toutes ses id\u00e9es, mais je soutiens certaines d\u2019entre elles et je crois qu\u2019il est un homme formidable et respectable. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9tudiant 4 : \u00ab Que ressentez-vous lorsqu\u2019en tant que politicien professionnel et membre du Conseil priv\u00e9, vous essayez de discuter avec des \u00e9tudiants qui n\u2019ont pas les m\u00eames connaissances que vous ? \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab \u00cates-vous un \u00e9lecteur ? \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 4 : \u00ab Oui, je suis un \u00e9lecteur. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Je m\u2019adresse aux \u00e9lecteurs qui changeront l\u2019avenir de ce pays. Je n\u2019essaie pas de critiquer les gens. Je m\u2019adresse simplement aux \u00e9lecteurs. \u00bb\n\n\u00c9tudiant 4 : \u00ab Cependant, vous \u00eates plus \u00e2g\u00e9 que tout le monde ici, et vous d\u00e9battez avec des \u00e9tudiants. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Tout d\u2019abord, je ne veux pas \u00eatre l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9phant dans la pi\u00e8ce, mais je n\u2019ai que 27 ans. Ce n\u2019est pas beaucoup plus vieux que tout le monde ici. De plus, je ne suis jamais all\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9. Oubliez l\u2019universit\u00e9. Vous \u00eates un \u00e9lecteur. Quel mal y a-t-il \u00e0 parler aux \u00e9lecteurs ? \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 4 : \u00ab Vous essayez d\u2019obtenir ce que vous voulez. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Comment ? \u00bb\n\n\u00c9l\u00e8ve 4 : \u00ab Vous faites venir des gens ici pour prouver que vous \u00eates meilleur que tout le monde. \u00bb\n\nZetix : \u00ab Je n\u2019ai forc\u00e9 personne \u00e0 venir ici.

This lone $600 fine must\u2019ve been lost during Covid and I had no idea it existed. If I did, I would have paid it immediately just as I did when I found out about it. All other conditions needed to be met to expunge disorderly persons and misdemeanor charges have been met.

Disqualifying factors include: felonies, violent, domestic abuse, burglary and other crimes of foul moral turpitude. These crimes usually do not allow an individual to work with patients or children. None of these apply to me.

As well as the clinical placement.\nI currently reached out to my district Senator and I am waiting to hear back. I\u2019m sure hoping you can help me .\nThanks in advance!\n\nBelow are the school policies, nowhere in these policies does it say the background check must be completely clear and free from all and any charges. Yet that\u2019s what I was told during a meeting.. my charges are also misdemeanors.\n\nCRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK\nClinical affiliates mandate criminal background checks for all students in patient care settings. Each student must undergo a criminal background check prior to admission to the program. These checks require a valid social security number. Federal and state laws preclude persons with certain criminal backgrounds from being in contact with children and patients. A felony conviction may affect a student's admission to the program and ability to attain state licensure. Some clinical affiliates require annual background checks, and students will be subject to another background check. These checks are conducted by an external vendor, and payment is the student's responsibility. The results of the checks are forwarded to the College and, upon request, to clinical sites. The vendor will evaluate the information and make the final determination on whether the student can engage in patient care. If a student is denied clinical placement by any clinical site due to criminal history information, that student will be dismissed from the program.\n\nBackground Check\nAll students enrolled in the Physical Therapist Assistant program are required to have a background check in order to participate in clinical practice. Students must sign and submit a Background Check Release Form and Disclosure Form prior to PTA 211 Clinical Practice I registration.\nAdditionally, some clinical affiliates require their own background checks. A criminal history may have an impact on enrollment in the Physical Therapist Assistant program and the subsequent ability to obtain licensure and employment as a PTA. If a student is denied clinical placement by any clinical site due to criminal history information, that student will be dropped from the program. The Academic Coordinator for Clinical Education will receive and review the results of the criminal background checks. Reasonable effort will be made to maintain the confidentiality of these records.\nReports will be maintained in student files in the Program's locked file cabinet. Students who believe that their personal information is inaccurate will need to have this resolved prior to clinical placement. It is the continued responsibility of the students to immediately report convictions of any crimes or offenses that occur after the completion of the background check.\n\nStudents who are pursuing a degree in physical therapy need to be aware of certain elements that potentially can impact fieldwork placement, certification, licensure, and future employment. Federal and various state laws are in place that preclude persons with criminal backgrounds from being in contact with children and patients.\nWhere these laws apply, you will be required to undergo a criminal background check which may include fingerprinting and a search of federal and state criminal data bases. Drug testing may also be required.\nA felony conviction may affect a graduate's ability to sit for and/or attain state licen-sure.", "subreddit": "physicaltherapy"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

I have a good one for you!\n\nBack in 2020 I began my first job out of college at a Writz Karlton, as a manager in training, in the desert region of California. My resume at this point was nothing but customer service/hospitality since I was a broke college student, therefore Warriott was the only company that would even consider hiring me. Mind you Im about 23 at this point and the \u201cmanager\u201d of about 3 employees. 2 of them are in their 50\u2019s so they are obviously not too keen on the fact that their manager is their child's age. However there was one employee in particular that I will never forget about, let\u2019s call her Jane.\n\nJane was my age and seemed to be very dedicated to her job as a Club Lounge Associate that paid minimum wage. She was the type of employee where if the rules state you have to clock in at 10AM, you have to clock in at 10AM on the dot. She did not hold back on her opinion and if you offered to lend her a hand, she would take your hand and RUN with it!\n\nOne day, the GM stopped by our department to see how things were going. She would do this periodically to boost morale and let us know we were all a team. Jane\u2026.had the General Manager\u2026. of the entire hotel\u2026..sweating on her knees scrubbing the floor of our kitchen. Why? Because the GM asked \u201cis there anything I can help you with right now?\u201d\n\nAs you can imagine the GM left our Club Lounge shocked and confused on what just happened. How could an employee feel so confident and brave to have upper management scrub floors, all while complaining to her about being understaffed. The GM had to pull us to the side and tell us we need to inform her about how her behavior is coming across.\n\nThe next day, I set up the breakfast buffet \u2026.out of order. Jane lets me know about the mistake I made. I let her know that I acknowledge the mistake and I will make corrections for the next morning. Jane cannot get over it.\n\nShe pulls me to the side and says \u201cCan I tell you something? I\u2019ve been thinking about something for a while and I can\u2019t get over it\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSure! Of course. What can I help you with?\u201d\n\nJane: \u201cI can\u2019t get over how the breakfast was set up this morning. Can you please make sure to have it in the proper order next time?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cJane\u2026. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. It was an honest mistake. It was hours ago. It is already lunch time.\n\nJane: \u201cIt is important that we follow the rules. There are pictures in the manual that shows how we are supposed to set up breakfast.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cThank you for bringing this to my attention. Now that we are bringing up things that are bothering us. I wanted to let you know that the GM is very upset with you. She said that you had her sweating, scrubbing floors and were throwing orders around like she was your assistant. She feels that you were being very bossy and not a team player. You should be more worried about this than the breakfast if I were you. You might lose your job \ud83d\ude2e \u201d\n\nShe was obviously panicked. This brought a smile to my face. The COVID quarantine happened shortly after so we were all let go. I wonder how she is doing now. Hopefully good.", "subreddit": "TalesFromTheFrontDesk"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

{"post": {"title": "Hidden gem, Eventbrite $EB", "id": "1i2wy0u", "created_utc": 1737055371.0, "selftext": "Eventbrite, $EB, is an experience platform, selling tickets to all sorts of events such as concerts, speed dating events, yoga classes, lectures and other.\nCurrently, it is cheap. Like very cheap and can at least double in 12M. Here is why.\n\nTHE BUSINESS\n\nPeople often think that it is a little brother of Tickermaster. It is not, as it hosts way smaller events and most of them are not about music. It's a unique niche market place. A better comparison would be Meetup, but it is even smaller, has less events, less users, less integrations with other platforms, and less possibilities for organisers.\n\nEventbrite has ~90 MAU, around 9% are coming from the mobile app.\nFor comparison, Similarweb believes Eventbrite had 40 million monthly visits in Dec'24, while Meetup only 14 million. The gap is huge.\n\nNext, Eventbrite is crazy profitable. Its gross margin is about 66-68% and it is growing as the company charges both organisers and users.\n\nHow do they plan to continue growing? In one of the recent quarterly calls they outlined a very simple yet logical strategy: city by city, focusing of major organisers who will bring users. They even have a dedicated sales force to attract organisers and recently introduced a customer support team. From go-to-market point of view, I think it makes perfect sense.\n\nWHY IS IT CHEAP\n\nAround Q4'2023 Eventbrite's management decided is was the time \"to kill\" free events and start charging a fee from organisers. Some organisers freaked out and left the platform. It hit revenue and crushed the share price from around 10-11 to around 3.\n\nIt took management approximately 3 quarters to realise the mistake and reverse the decision. They brought back the free tier in Sep'24. The early results shared in Oct'24 were positive. Since then the share price bounced from 2.5 to 3.5, but still way below what it used to be a year ago.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nAfter reading it, one might think the management is dumb and unprofessional. It is far from truth.\n\nFirst, Covid almost killed Eventbrite, as nobody was going to face-to-face events. Revenue crushed from 340 million to 110 million, there were a lot of restructuring, but Eventbrite recovered. in 2023 they reached preCOVID level of 330 million only to stumble again in Q3 last year. \n\nFounders, Kevin and Julia Hartz, are wealthy. Kevin is an enterprenuer and early stage investor. He is best known for launching and selling Xoom to PayPal, and investing in Airbnb in its early days. He is still active, recently launching two new startups.\n\nWhat is important, he is not a bystander. He knows what he does, and he still seats on the board of the company.\n\nI believe, founders are long term focused.\nAlso, founders have overwhelming control over the company through class B share structure. This structure will cease to exist in 2028. Until then, I think, the company will focus on growth to potentially sell it in 2028.\n\nInteresting fact, in Q4 2024, Eventbrite snatched a star CFO from Viator (owned by Tripadvisor). Viator was performing amazingly well recently, so I think it\u2019s a promising addition to Eventbrite team.\n\nHOW MUCH\n\nIt is priced P/S is 1, while average in the sector is 2. I also did DFC model and got around 7, so 2x from current 3.4.\n\nThe company has a lot of cash, but most of it is just a temporary holdup for the organizers. Their true cash is almost the same as its long term debt, so essentially it is debt free and most probably will become FCF positive on an annual basis next year (EDIT: this year, 2025). It was already FCF positive in Q3'24.\n\nIf it is not enough, Eventbrite currently conducts a massive buyback program. They have around 50 million in authorisation that at current market cap of 331 million equals to approximately to 15% of the shares outstanding. If you believe in DFC, this fact alone should increase the price by 1 dollar.\nNet-net, it is at least x2 opportunity.\n\nRISKS\n\nOf course they can fail.\n\nTheir main problem is competitors. So far the closest competitor, Meetup is way smaller. Another type of competitor is social networks. Facebook has Eventbrite's functionality, but despite this fact, Eventbrite continue growing.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like the glory days of Facebook are gone.\n\nDISCLOSURE.\n\nI've got a lot of Eventbrite. It is about 120k in $EB. Only vanilla shares, no options.\nSo my conviction is here.\nTLDR;\n\n\n$EB is crazy cheap. It should trade for 7-8, but trades for 3.4. Its is a good chance to double your money this year.\n\nCheers\n", "subreddit": "pennystocks"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

I also read The Refulators 3 months back so not reading that one either.\n\nAfter book 7 I'm then gonna read The Talisman and Black House as hopefully Talisman 3 will be out after that, which I'm super excited for. As a side note, if there are any other books you'd recommend for a Dark Tower mega read, please let me know.\n\nAnyways, with that out the way, onto Tull. My memory betrayed me and I thought Tull happened before the amazing line \"The Man in Black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed, which we know after reading the final book is outside the time loop. I always thought his massacre/sacrifice of Tull would be something he would be able to rectify in one of his later time loops, but no, his guilt over Alice and the town will haunt hime throughout all of his loops. Another addition to his sins that need to be cleansed before he can truly make peace with himself and be worthy of truly reaching the top of the tower without being subject to time loop shennanigans.\n\nAnother thought I had was when he was talking to Brown, he considered murdering him. Do you think in previous time loops, that might be something he actually did? Him finally getting the horn in the most recent loop suggests Roland is changing each loop, becoming a better person with each loop. He may have been a much worse person in earlier loops and that fleeting thought might be some residual physic residue of his past actions.\n\nAnother thought I had that is do you think he draws the same people each loop. It is suggested that those Roland draws on his adventures are there to wash his sins and make him a better person, less likely to heartlessly sacrifice others for his goal of the tower. Maybe his drawing of Eddie, Sussanah and Jake was the trio that actually worked, allowing for the tower to gift him the horn for hopefully his final trip to the tower and forgiveness for his sins.\n\nFinally, do you think the two different versions of The Gunslinger and in fact two different trips around the tower? This might back up the idea that he draws different people each time and events play slightly differenly each loop except for his inevitable rise to the top of the tower. In the revised edition, Eddie Dean and Odetta/Detta walker are hinted at much more directly than they are in the original version and the number 19 plays a larger part in the narrative. It is also my pet theort that Walter/Marten/Flagg is aware of the time loop, given some of the mocking cryptic clues about time he mentions during his palaver and he is along for the ride, not truly caring about stopping Roland reaching the Tower, knowing he is doomed to repeat it all again and again. This might explain his cockiness right up until he is eaten my Mort, something that hadn't happened before amd caught him off guard.\n\nSorry for the ling ramble. My most recent reread of The Gunslinger, normally one of my lesser liked King books, struck a wonderful chord with me and inspired a whole load of new thoughts and wild theories.\n\nLet me know what you think of them and point out any plotholes I may have missed.\n\nLong days and pleasant nights my fellow constant readers!", "subreddit": "TheDarkTower"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

Emma's parents are abroad, and this seems like a perfect opportunity for the two friends to relax and enjoy some time alone. As they walk down the winding forest path, Lila feels a lingering unease stemming from her childhood traumas but is excited about the fun time she will have with Emma.\n\n**Chapter 2: Safe Haven**\n\nUpon arrival, Emma and Lila settle in, unpacking their belongings and lighting a campfire to share stories. The silence of the forest is only interrupted by the occasional sound of wildlife. As the sun sets, they savor the moment of their strengthened friendship.\n\n**Chapter 3: The Whisper of Threat**\n\nAs the night progresses, they start hearing strange noises outside the house. Initially, they assume the sounds are just the normal noises of the forest, but soon they realize the noises are becoming more distinct and eerie. Looking out the window, they see a shadow moving in the darkness.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Face of Danger**\n\nVictor Kane, a psychopath, manages to sneak into the house. Awakened by the noises, Lila and Emma realize that Victor is a limitless danger lurking in the shadows nearby. Victor has lost his sanity due to a traumatic event he once experienced in these woods.\n\n**Chapter 5: The Fight for Survival**\n\nVictor begins to threaten the girls both physically and psychologically. Using objects in the house, he tries to frighten them, setting traps and manipulating their fears. Amidst the chaos, Emma gets injured, and Lila takes on the responsibility of protecting her. Maintaining her composure, Lila engages in a mental battle with Victor.\n\n**Chapter 6: The Birth of the Final Girl**\n\nRecalling the lessons from her childhood traumas in the woods, Lila confronts Victor. Overcoming her own fears, she outsmarts and defeats Victor with her intelligence and courage. While keeping Emma safe, she manages to subdue Victor.\n\n**Chapter 7: The End**\n\nThe police arrive just in time to rescue Lila and Emma. Victor Kane's body disappears into the woods, maintaining its mystery. As Lila leaves behind the night of terror, she discovers a newfound strength within herself. Her survival story becomes a turning point for a new beginning.\n\n**Chapter 8: A New Day**\n\nWith the first light of dawn, Lila and Emma emerge from the traumatic experience, proud of their survival. However, they still feel the lingering presence of Victor in the woods, leaving a lasting mark on their lives. Lila is now stronger and more determined; she has become a true **Final Girl**.", "subreddit": "horrorstories"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

Some of these might go too far, but you never know until you ask the community:\n\n* For the ad-supported tier\n    * Play a 30-second Raid Shadow Legends ad before every boss encounter and in between Sire phases\n    * Put a little TV in the gauntlet lobby that plays ads for BetterHelp and Activia\n    * There's some open space in between inventory items that players often misclick. You could use this space for invisible referral links to random Amazon pages. It could make a few bucks?\n    * Prevent users from receiving drops from bosses until they answer a survey question like, \"Would you rather take your family out to Chili's or cook at home during a holiday?\" That info is invaluable for advertisers\n* The afk timer feature is pretty cool, but let's go further. \"Would you pay extra to make random events peaceful again?\" That should scare 'em\n* Frankly I think you're being too lenient with the support topic. Instead of just giving out customer support for a few extra bucks, you can really extract some cash if you introduce an auction for customer support. Let players outbid each other for your time\n* You could start a patreon that allows users access to new content first. It worked for my YouTuber friend\n* Add one of those \"buy me a coffee\" links by the minimap so we can help out the board of directors of of CVC\n* At the log out screen you could ask for a tip. 18%, 20% and 25% perform well for most demographics but you could increase it\n\nAnyway, what do you think of these ideas? As long as we only send these to a couple people in the community we should be able to contain any backlash. But let's be honest we shouldn't expect any. The community loves us\n\nThanks, xoxo :)", "subreddit": "2007scape"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

It's too long to come back to the circuit. My theory is that in the new mario kart, all the tracks are connected in a giant world, and there will be a feature where you can drive, or race, between the tracks.

We knew we wanted to get pregnant in 2025, so we'd been intentionally sloppy with our rhythm method over the holidays. But on days 32, 33, 34 of my cycle we had attributed the lateness of my period to the cold I had right after the holidays- we figured my body was simply \"out of whack\". Well, I took that test as soon as I could. I did what you do to the stick, and brought it out to my man. I had a timer set for 2 minutes and wasn't going to look until that buzzer went off.  He peeked before it was fully cooked and gave me a smile. I couldn't tell if he was teasing me, so looked as well- AND BAM! PREGGO!  I took the second test too, you know, just to be sure (I can't be the only one who did that! haha).  And while \"We're Pregnant!!\" is still sinking in, we realize: We're about to see my mom! She was joining us at a brewery where we play in a cornhole league! HOW are we going to hide this from her? We certainly aren't ready to tell her yet... But we lucked out (for now, anyway) since my fianc\u00e9 and I have been doing dry January.  My mom teased me that \"oh if you only drink a few days, it's basically a dry January! It's a damp January!\", which is a fair thing to tease me about because I did imbibe to celebrate my sister's birthday on Jan 3rd, but I was able to \"stay strong\" and drink my club soda without giving away our wonderful secret :)\n\n  \nAnyway, it's only been a day since we learned that baby is on his/her way and I've already ravaged Amazon for a pregnancy journal and three pregnancy books!\n\n  \nLooking forward to this journey with you all <3", "subreddit": "September2025Bumps"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

The reason I have trouble calculating this is because his vast speed comes from spells with varying durations. When I can, I tend to use Glyph of warding with Haste or Ashardalons stride for a boost.

Assuming im just running as I travel, I Dash with every available action. Mobile feat and climb speed means I largely ignore terrain. I can cover 2880 feet on the first turn I move, but then it ramps down rapidly. This is still well in excess of highway speeds and should allow me to slash travel time.

La Feminarqu\u00eda Neoreaccionaria (FNRx), rechaza las nociones de democracia y liberalismo como sistemas \"desordenados\". Sin embargo, introduce un enfoque que combina orden autoritario con pol\u00edticas pro-derechos reproductivos y laborales exclusivos para mujeres.\n\nLa reproducci\u00f3n no es un derecho, sino un privilegio estrictamente regulado.

He identified a special type of star, called a Cepheid variable, within the Andromeda \"nebula.\" This seemingly insignificant star, called V1, proved that Andromeda was actually a separate galaxy far beyond our own Milky Way.\n#\nBefore this, many astronomers thought the Milky Way was the entire universe. Hubble's discovery shattered that idea and revealed a cosmos vastly larger and more complex than anyone had imagined. It was a major turning point in cosmology, the study of the universe's origins and development.\n#\nHubble didn't stop there. He went on to measure the distances and velocities of many other galaxies, leading to another groundbreaking discovery: the universe is expanding. This realization, based on the work of Hubble and other astronomers like Vesto Slipher and Georges Lema\u00eetre, eventually led to the Big Bang theory, which explains the origin of the universe.\n#\nHubble's legacy continues to this day with the Hubble Space Telescope, a marvel of engineering that has allowed astronomers to peer even deeper into the cosmos. The telescope has revealed a universe filled with wonders, from colliding galaxies to black holes, and has helped refine our understanding of the universe's age and expansion.\n#\nIn fact, the Hubble telescope has even uncovered new mysteries, like the accelerating expansion of the universe driven by \"dark energy.\" This mysterious force is one of the biggest puzzles in modern cosmology, and scientists are still working to understand its nature.\n#\nEdwin Hubble's observations of a single star a century ago opened up a universe of discovery. His work revolutionized our place in the cosmos and continues to inspire astronomers today as they explore the vastness of space.\n", "subreddit": "abovethenormnews"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

He didn't try to take it further, we were just sitting next to each other and chatting happily. We've done that before but it was usually with the other event organizers. I'm also a foreigner here so for me naked sauna can easiely be awkward but it just felt right.I thought to myself 'I would love to do this every day'.\n\nWhy am I happy TODAY?

It's such a joyful activity, counting and caring for the cute little fuzzy robots.\n\nMy favorites are the drones, they are so lazy and often sit on you. After taking of the beesuit I usually had a few on my hand that I could veeeeery carefully pet on the fuzzy back and then return to the hive. All the bees are cute little buggers tho <3\n\nNot only has the beekeeping helped me find great friends, but it also solved my skin issues. When we harvested our honey a friend told me to put some on a pimple, and boom....gone the next fucking day. It works for everything. An eczema I had for years just went away after 2 weeks of honey. WTF. I went to the goddamn dermatologist for all of this shit for 10 years...and tada! My bee friends solved it for me.\n\nIdk, the fact that it's the honey from bees I've been taking care of is so joyful to me. I feel so fulfilled, just thinking about going every week. Last week  I was dolled up for a party and our Queen Bee messaged that he is doing a short inspection. I immedietly dropped everything and went beekeeping in high heels and a fancy dress, wading through mud to get to the hives. Before I left I told a new classmate and he wanted to come. He has joined the hivebuddies now too, and it's just all so nice, and wholesome, and happy, and sweet, and loving. Everyone is so wonderful, no one is superficial and the disciplines we come from are so different! I'd never have met these people without the fuzzy little friends...they give so much back for the little we give them.\n\nSo I just wanted to say: I am really, really happy today because we are meeting later today and I can't wait to go to the hives again <3\n\n(For the record: we only use sutainable beekeeping practices, limited amount of hives to not disturb ocal bees, no wingclipping or other such bullshit and don't sugarfeed! The bees are very happy.)", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

He is a never again kind of person and I truly love him with all my heart and soul. \nTo all the Redditors reading this, I just wanna say that not all roads lead us to the end. Some are just beginnings, just that we may not find that out all too soon. Thank you for reading.

We've especially been talking more this week, and I was so happy because he asked for my number a couple days ago. Today when we were talking towards the end of class, though, I had mentioned that a couple things I really like are photography and hiking. One thing he asked was about which trail was my favorite, and when I told him, he said he really liked that one too because it was pretty close and he enjoyed going mountain biking there. Eventually, he said that he (and I quote), \"would love (!) to take \\[me\\] there\" this weekend, because I had mentioned that I didn't really have any plans. I said that sounded like it would be super fun and that I'd be happy to go with him, and by the end of our chat, he said he would call me later so we could work out our plans. Fast forward to when I was at home, and I was so nervous once again for when he would call me because it's actually our first time talking on the phone and doing something outside of school. When he did call, my heart was practically pounding, but I was able to answer it on time, and I only say this because of how crazy everything felt at that moment. Long-ish story short, he's picking me up at 11 in the morning tomorrow, and I think I'm more excited than I've ever been. I wasn't so sure what to make of it, but he actually called it \"our date\" while we were on the phone, so I cannot get that out of my head now. I already have some nice memories from that specific trail we're going on, and it now means even more to me than ever that I'm actually going on my first date ever there. I never would've expected something like this to happen in my life even a month or so ago (especially because I didn't even know him very well at all then), and I thought I would just get through high school being almost completely alone and maybe meet someone special in my adult life if I'm lucky, but hey.

I was 11 when I watched frozen and it's weird to say I grew up idolising Anna (cus I'm ginger, lol) I also had fun dressed as Anna, did my hair and makeup and wore something reminiscent of her style, gotta say I was looking and feel like my childhood dream! \n\nAfter we went to burger king for lunch/dinner and I was basically about to become an ice statue because I forgot my coat. Parents were gonna surprise us with a trip the the city center to see the light but we had to go home to fetch my coat so surprise was kinda spoiled when everyone was told we were going back out again (as opposed to driving straight to town)\n\nWe got to town and the lights were beautiful, we all went on the carousel and I was looking a little like Mary Poppins with my vintage style and long blue dress along with Anna hair and makeup. I felt fabulous. We quickly went home as it was getting very cold and the little ones were tired from all the excitement.\n\nWe got home and all sat together and assembled premade gingerbread Christmas trees and it was fun seeing all our different designs.\n\nI'm currently laying in bed full of joy and love (and cookies) This is what Christmas is meant to feel like, this is Family. They are the most supportive, funny and crazy weird people I know and I love it, I love them. All.\n\nTL:Dr \nDad treated me and older to McDonalds breakfast, saw frozen 2 with family and I dressed as anna, had burger king for lunch/dinner, somewhat surprise trip to town to see the Christmas lights and go on rides, go home and made gingerbread Christmas trees.

{"post": {"title": "TIAH because I got to see one of my favorite musicals, and got to meet one of my favorite actors.", "id": "c78h1w", "created_utc": 1561865192.0, "selftext": "Hi all! Let me begin with the obligatory \"it didn't happen today\" rather, it happened yesterday, but the joy is still in my system! So, I'm a huge theatre nerd. More specifically, musical theatre nerd. I absolutely love musicals (if you have any recommendations for musicals for me to checkout please hmu!) and musical theatre actors. I'm from Greenville, South Carolina, which is a very theatre oriented city. However, sometimes our big theatre is overlooked during tours of musicals. This happened with the national tour of the show Falsettos (Absolutely BEAUTIFUL show. Can't recommend it enough.) Falsettos is one of my favorite musicals (Light opera, technically) My boyfriend knew that, and being the amazing guy he is bought us tickets to see it when it came to Charlotte, for that was the closest place to see it.\n\nI'd been so excited about seeing it, and when the day finally came my excitement grew into shock and joy. Before I saw the show, I never checked the cast list. In the lobby of the theatre there was a board with the names of the actors, with both base cast and understudies (The base cast is comprised of the regular actors for each character. An understudy is someone who, if needed, will play a character if the main actor is unable to.) I saw a name I recognized on it, and I gasped audibly and tried not to squeal and/or start crying tears of joy. Nick. Fuckin. Blaemire. If you're not into theatre, you probably won't recognize that name, but he's one of my favorite actors EVER! He was in the original broadway cast of the musical Godspell, and he played Plankton in SpongeBob the Musical in Chicago (Yes, that exists.) \n\nSomething then struck me - The board had names with the base actors AND understudies, and I got insanely worried that Nick was merely an understudy. We get into the auditorium, and I open my program (A pamphlet with all the information about the show you're seeing) and I quickly went to the cast page, and guess what? His name in the list of the base cast. I gasped again and started to gush about Nick Blaemire to my boyfriend (Bless my boyfriend's heart.) And the second I heard Nick sing I remember thinking \"Holy shit. I get to hear him sing in person for the first time.\" And he sounded great! I love his voice and skill. \n\nAfter the show, we quickly went to ask a security guard where the stage door was (The stage door is a door in the theatre where the actors leave after a show. It's very common for actors to go to the stage door and greet people who came to see the show, give autographs and take pictures and whatnot.) When Nick gets to me in the line of people (Yep. A line) he greets me, I ask for his autograph and a picture and he did both. He was so, so kind. I will never forget this day. He's one of my biggest role models and I got to MEET HIM. Now I just need to meet Andrew Rannells and Rory O'Malley. \n\nTL;DR: Was pleasantly surprised to see one of my favorite actors was in a show i saw, and was able to meet him.", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

This is my 3rd and final chance at taking this class, and I\u2019m working very hard to become a community college math professor. Knowing that it\u2019s finally just between me and the math, not me, the math, and my ex... Again, huge sigh of relief... aaaaahhhhhhhhhh\n\nFeels good. \n\nThis last part I\u2019m going to be intentionally vague for the time being. The important thing is I\u2019m really close to getting some medical tests I truly believe I would benefit from getting. To qualify though I have to prove it was present in childhood. From the information they gathered they called to decline me today for intake. Except this was the first time I got to provide my experience directly to clarify what they had gathered. Not only did I get to clarify, SHE LISTENED!!! Now I get to submit my experience in my own words rather than through the observations of others, and I\u2019ll be reconsidered when they meet mid-next week!!!\n\nWhich brings me back to my title... \n\nToday I am truly happy because so many things that I have been patiently been putting so much work into all started moving into their respective next major stages. \n\nOh! And the head boop I got from my kitty while writing all this. That also made me happy today lol\n\nTL;DR: After months of excruciating patience, my financial stability, my freedom from abuse, my make it or break it school goals, and a very important health issue ALL finally started moving forward again today!

I also enjoy the tropes of blind date, baker meets person from service/farmer that supplies her bakery, mermaid, mafia, and a new addition of something like the hit tv series \u201c The Nanny\u201d \n\nI personally am all about the more cliche romance it is, the more fun it is.

In 2017, when Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon released, I got Ultra Moon. I enjoyed my run quite a bit, especially seeing as I started off with a random Pok\u00e9rus-infected Pok\u00e9mon! Anyhow, we'll fast forward to slightly later in the story where you are supposed to enter the Ultra Space Wilds. In the Wilds, you can encounter the legendary Pok\u00e9mon that aren't in the rest of the game. When I learnt about this, I decided I'd come back later in the game to shiny hunt a Lugia, because I absolutely adore its shiny form. What happened, however, was that my very first encounter in the Ultra Space Wilds was a Lugia, and I had no idea whether I could return to its habitat after encountering it for the first time. In any case: I wasn't about to take any chances and started my hunt then and there.\n\nCue my disappointment, however: after tens of hours (rookie numbers, of course), there was no luck to be had. I kept trying and trying and trying, but after days and weeks, I wasn't having fun anymore and I... gave up. In 2018, I had another good run at it, but still: nothing. Since then, every year I'd had a couple of days in which I'd vigorously hunt for my shiny Lugia, but to no avail...\n\nThen, as this year started, I thought to myself \"Well, MelodiousOddity, you never have any New Year's resolutions, how about just this one to finally get the shiny Lugia?\" With a couple of nice football (soccer) games to watch and tons of snooker and some Balatro (in which I - of course - got invested, great game), I set out to finally try my absolute hardest. And today, while watching another snooker match, after seven years, I finally got my Sundown! I have to admit, I screamed a little!\n\nIts nature is Gentle, which I'm plenty happy about. It's probably not the optimal nature but I'm just so darn happy I finally got it, I just had to share it with you guys!\n\nSo: Happy New Year everyone and to all those shiny hunters that are stuck like I was, I wish you a speedy success and all the happiness you deserve when you finally get them! :D", "subreddit": "pokemon"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

{"post": {"title": "How to make an Au Pair feel welcome?", "id": "1i31xre", "created_utc": 1737068430.0, "selftext": "An Au Pair arriving is a special and exciting experience but can come with some anxiety.  You may wondering \"How can I make them feel comfortable in my home\"? Or \"What should I provide to my Au Pair?\"  Read on for some tips to help you to have an amazing experience.\n\n**Making them feel welcome**\n\nThere are many things you can do to make your Au Pair feel welcome right away.\n\n**Arrival:**  First things first, pick up your Au Pair at the airport.  Know their flight number and keep in communication via text or Whats app to know about any delays and remember customs can take a while.\n\n* *Tip:*  Don't just pull up to curbside, we all know how overwhelming that can be especially in an unfamiliar airport.  Greet your Au Pair inside the airport near baggage claim or meet and greet area.  Have your kids make a welcome sign, bring balloons.  You won't regret seeing the look on your Au Pair's face when they see you in person for the first time!  Consider a welcome gift like a gift basket or something your children made for them.\n\n**Let the Au Pair rest:**  Au Pairs are required to have 3 days after arrival to settle in to the home and cannot be left alone with the children providing child care during that time.\n\n* *Tip:*  *Let your Au Pair get some rest after arrival, think about how far they have traveled and how overwhelmed they could be in a new environment.*\n\n**Schedule Your Orientation:**  You and your Au Pair will need to have an Orientation with your Local Area Representative (LAR) within the first 2 weeks of the Au Pairs arrival.\n\n* *Tip:  Schedule your Orientation sooner rather than later.  The Au Pair will be able to meet their LAR right away and know who to talk to about any questions early on.*\n\n**Show the Au Pair around:**  Your Au Pair is likely in a place they have never been before so you will need to show them your town and where important locations are like your kids school or library.  Also, show them around your home.\n\n* *Tip:  This can be a good time to show the Au Pair some fun places in your town that may interest your Au Pair.  While driving around show them how your vehicle works and what U.S. driving looks like. Homes are different from country to country, you will likely have to show your Au Pair how to use the your laundry machines and dishwasher.  Don't forget to give your Au Pair the grand tour of your home.*\n\n**Make sure your Au Pair feels like family:**  It's important to build on a bond with your Au Pair right away.\n\n* *Tip:  Plan something for your family and Au Pair to do together.  This could be a \"Get to Know You\" activity or special location in your city.*\n\n**Your Home**\n\nAs a Host Family you are responsible for providing your Au Pair with room and board but, what does that mean exactly?  The best way to describe this is by giving an example.  Think about what you would provide to a family member or friend visiting your home.  You would want them to feel welcome and comfortable.  Here are some tips on what to provide to your Au Pair living in your home.\n\n**Accommodations:**  Host Families are required to provide a private bedroom with basic furnishings.  This private room is typically within the Host Family's home.\n\n* *Tip: To make it feel like home think about what things will make your Au Pair feel comfortable in a new environment.  Print some photos of your Au Pair's family and put them in frames in the room.  Create a welcome basket with some basic essentials.  You can also take your Au Pair shopping for some decor when they arrive.*\n\n**Meals:**  You will also need to provide your Au Pair with at least 3 meals a day.  These meals can be part of your regular groceries that you usually buy your family but purchase enough for the Au Pair as well.\n\n* *Tip:  Consider taking your Au Pair to the grocery store with you to show them around but also have them pick out some items they may want.  You could also see if there is a grocery store that is specifically catered to their culture.  Food is a great way to bond so consider sharing meals with each other of cultural significance.*\n\n**Toiletries and House basics:**  As a Host Family you will have the basics of this covered.  For example linens, toilet paper, soap and shampoo and conditioner.  If there are certain brands or special toiletries an Au Pair wants they can purchase those themselves.\n\n* *Tip:  Think about what items would make you feel welcome in a space you haven't been before.  Take in to consideration this is not only a new home but an entirely new country that may differ in ways of the home.*\n\nUsing these tips you are likely to make your Au Pair feel welcome and a part of your Family in no time!", "subreddit": "goaupair"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

It's that time again where we take stock of what we've achieved over the past year, and then look ahead to what we have planned for 2025.\n\n\n\nIn terms of progress, in 2024 we released a total of\u00a0**57 development builds**\u00a0for our backer community to check out, with a release cadence of\u00a0**1-2 new builds per week**\u00a0during the latter half of the year.\n\n\n\nWe also launched a new series of regular live development streams, with a total of\u00a0**96 live streams**\u00a0in 2024. That's over\u00a0**128 hours**\u00a0worth of live development action, with most streams averaging 3-4 hours long. If you haven't been watching, then why not join the fun every Wednesday and Sunday on YouTube:\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/@StarshipSimulator](https://www.youtube.com/@StarshipSimulator)\n\n\n\nOf course, the biggest news of the year by far was our unbelievably successful Kickstarter campaign in April, where\u00a0**5,761 backers**\u00a0pledged a mind-blowing \u00a3402,085. After the usual fees and tax deductions, that was a \u00a3290,000 cash injection into the studio, which we're using to bring additional talent onto the project.\n\n\n\nIn other news, thanks to our other fantastic backers on Patreon and Ko-Fi, we were able to construct our brand new\u00a0\"**Dev Shed**\", a dedicated studio space for development and streaming.\n\n\n\nAs for the game itself, during 2024 we focused on several core features;\n\n\n\n**GALAXY GEN**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpdlytreqfde1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a2fef88dd05d87fd7c09a9bdd1648dad9396739\n\n  \nWe completely overhauled the Galaxy Gen system, adding refinement and optimisation across the board. The coordinate system was re-based to place Sag A\\* at 0,0,0, and thanks to a new seed system with\u00a0**2\\^256 unique vector-based seeds**\u00a0(a truly massive number), every cubic lightyear of space now has its own unique seed.\n\n\n\nWe also significantly increased the number of real-world stars in the game, with\u00a018.2 million Gaia Catalogue Objects\u00a0now extending out to a radius of 2,000 LY around Sol. Without wanting to blow our own trumpet too much, this makes our simulated Milky Way galaxy the largest and most accurate ever made for the consumer market, and we're only just getting started!\n\n\n\nTo help render all of that new data, we also added L, T and Y class brown dwarf stars to the game, along with over\u00a070 new stellar sub-classes.\n\n\n\n**SYSTEM GEN**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m65is41iqfde1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f2efeb94b002c16c901430b3a52600146e5f48a\n\n  \nJust as with the Galaxy Gen, we completely overhauled the code for generating Star Systems within the game. In addition to numerous optimisations, we also added significantly more detail to the generation process. Here are a few highlights:\n\n\n\nOur planet formation model now uses\u00a0**Core Mass Accretion**\u00a0when forming initial planetary cores, with iron content properly decreasing with distance from the central star.\n\n\n\nGas Giants are now formed using\u00a0**Runaway Gas Accretion**, whereby the gas envelope grows exponentially when the escape velocity of the planetary core is greater than that of molecular hydrogen.\n\n\n\nA star's\u00a0**Roche Limit**\u00a0is now properly taken into account when generating the innermost planets in a system, along with that star's\u00a0**Dust Sublimation Line**. This ensures the orbits of the innermost planets are scientifically accurate.\n\n\n\nOnce a star's proto-planetary disk has been largely exhausted of mass, a\u00a0**Scattered Disk**\u00a0of small icy bodies is generated with increasingly eccentric and inclined orbits. This is similar to our own Kuiper Belt, which includes the likes of Pluto, Eris, Haumea and Makemake. All of which are also now in the game.\n\n\n\n**LIFE GEN**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vnzw8oujqfde1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b9a96fa81a35367f939dea14b206d435ba3fe3e\n\n  \nWe started work on our Life Gen system, which now applies a high-level\u00a0**Political States**\u00a0to galactic sectors when they are generated. This determines if a sector consists of independent worlds, multiple factions, or even a single all-powerful empire.\n\n\n\n**Alien civilisations**\u00a0are now also being generated throughout the entire galaxy, with the initial groundwork complete for generating data points such as:\n\n\n\n* **Name**\n* **Physiology**\n* **Government**\n* **Religion**\n* **Tech Level**\n* **Aggressiveness**\n* **Xenophobia**\n\n\n\nThese data points are now available on the sensors console, with long range scans identifying\u00a0**Tech Signatures**\u00a0on inhabited worlds. A short range scan of that world will then reveal all of the current data in text form.\n\n\n\nThis is of course just the starting point for the Life Gen system. Over time the amount and detail of the generated data will increase significantly, culminating in those races eventually being given physical form.\n\n\n\n**SENSORS GAMEPLAY**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nipgu6clqfde1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=fff53fabf33be72ae3ee3f9dc2add1c8c6064ae3\n\n  \nWith greatly improved galaxy generation and alien civilisations popping up all over the place, it was important that we also overhauled the Sensors UI to manage all of this new data.\n\n\n\nThe Sensors UI now has four distinct modes, with each serving a specific purpose when uncovering more information about a target system:\n\n\n\n* The\u00a0**GPS**\u00a0mode tracks your location in the galaxy, provides a scientific overview of your current sector of space, and lists the number of each star class located within that sector.\n* The\u00a0**Long Range**\u00a0mode lists all of the star systems in range, and allows you to perform a Long Range Survey of any system within 2,000 LY to uncover basic details about its orbital bodies. Any tech signatures will also be highlighted, should they exist.\n* The\u00a0**Medium Range**\u00a0mode has a maximum range of 0.5 LY. A Medium Range Survey will uncover more details about each planet in a system, such as a gas giant's specific type or whether or not a planet is an Earth Analogue. This mode will also reveal moons and other smaller objects.\n* The\u00a0**Short Range**\u00a0mode has a maximum range of 3,000,000 km, and conducting a short range scan of a planet will reveal its full details, such as its surface composition and whether or not life exists there. You can even view a map of the planet's surface now.\n\n\n\nAll objects in a star system now have\u00a0**3 knowledge levels**, with the Short, Medium and Long range sensors being worth knowledge level 3, 2 and 1 respectively. This of course means that in order to fully explore a star system, all bodies must be scanned to knowledge level 3.\n\n\n\nThis exploration data is naturally saved as part of the save system within the game, so players can now begin the process of surveying the galaxy across multiple play sessions to seek out all of those new alien civilisations.\n\n\n\n**MAGELLAN CLASS REFIT**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmqbg1hnqfde1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=bed97c0902f4c32fe05a757c9046c4696b41b20d\n\n  \nOur Magellan Class prototype exploration vessel underwent her most significant refit to date, with the addition of an\u00a0**Alcubierre Ring**\u00a0and a greatly expanded interior layout.\n\n\n\nThe ship received an\u00a0**Updated Framework Structure**\u00a0to support a new segmented design, which is an important change because it paves the way for modeling things like Air Pressure, Air Quality, Fire Spread, and other dynamic environmental effects.\n\n\n\nThe new framework structure also required new wall and floor panels, so we took advantage of that opportunity to increase their level of detail, in addition to adding new features such as\u00a0**Nanite Tesselation**\u00a0for per-pixel levels of surface detail.\n\n\n\nWe also added a\u00a0**Working Crew Lift**\u00a0to the main stairwell, as well as\u00a0**Dynamic Carpet Grime**\u00a0with an accompanying cleaning robot to test out our NPC task priority system.\n\n\n\nClaire also set about doing some gardening on the ship, with our previously empty planters now filled with colourful foliage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2444ldipqfde1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d06a806b2ec55a16eff75e016592c19758aacb\n\n**ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS**\n\n\n\nWe've been listening closely to your feedback, and with that in mind we've made some improvements to accessibility in the game.\n\n\n\nThe default camera mode having Headbob enabled was a point of contention for quite a few players, so we've removed it from the camera cycle entirely. Instead, Headbob is now an optional feature that you have to specifically enable in the gameplay options.\n\n\n\nPlayers with significant visual impairment raised concerns about UI text being too small, or other details being difficult to see, so we've added a \"Camera Zoom\" slider to the accessibility options. This gives you control over how much right-click zooms the camera.\n\n\n\nAlso related to visual impairment, we've added 23 different crosshairs of various shapes and sizes to the control options.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**LOOKING AHEAD INTO 2025**\n\n\n\nWe're painfully overdue a public demo update, so that's very much the first thing on the agenda. We're dotting the T's and crossing the I's on that at the moment, so hopefully we'll have that released imminently.\n\n\n\nOnce Tech Demo #3 is released, we're going to focus heavily on recruitment. With Early Access planned for December this year, we've got a tremendous uphill struggle ahead of us. We know exactly who we need, we just need to find those talented individuals.\n\n\n\nWith our recruitment drive out of the way, we'll then work on a dedicated VR test build. We're keen to see how well the game plays in VR, and if all goes to plan it's going to be an extremely immersive experience.\n\n\n\nThe next patch cycle, 226, will focus on the Bridge gameplay. Specifically, the ability to issue commands to NPC or Player crewmembers. This will be achieved by either interacting with the Holo Display, or by looking over at the crewmember and bringing up a command interface.\n\n\n\nWe'll also flesh out more of the Bridge interior, with a view to getting that finished and polished if time permits. On the galaxy side of things, we'll finally be adding moons to the game!\n\n\n\nAnd speaking of timescales, our new year's resolution is to keep patches small and focused. We really dropped the ball with that in 2024, so that's our biggest priority for 2025.\n\n\n\nOk, that's it from me. I'd like to say a huge thankyou once again to everyone that has supported us thus far, and we'll continue to work hard to make this project the best it can possibly be!", "subreddit": "StarshipSimulator"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

I want to share it with the community.", "id": "1i31onu", "created_utc": 1737067737.0, "selftext": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GAwdgR-NnCeqk1QXu97b6HUu8JjBvUeLaiqyDzsmr1U/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.v0svf8mdq6vn\n\n**Observations on Mechanics**\n\nIn general, I think that in the design of this game, players focus on the things that I wanted them to focus on.\nResource and command management, reactions to the opponent, and general ship-building and placement strategies are what players spend the most time doing. The dice math and mechanics of the game are very simple and flat.\n\nI tried to make units strong in the ways they are in the video game and made the math so that RU cost and damage output were pretty balanced. I did create some tables to help figure averages but ended up going mostly by feel and testing. Unit type limitations per game size help to not have game-breaking strategies. \nThe game moves quickly and looks great on the table once everything gets going. One of the major goals was to make a game that draws people at the FLGS in to see what that cool space game is. (having a 5\u201d tall painted Pride of Hiigara will do that)\n\n**Model Count**\n\nWhile designing and playtesting I realized that I had made a game that required a ton of models. After thinking about it, I accepted it. That was the game I had envisioned. \n\nIt was one of the major time sinks personally and I think it can be a barrier to entry.  3D printing and painting the models can take a lot of time and can be costly. At a certain point, I realized that this game is probably better served by punch board chits. Pre-cut ship tokens that are rectangular and circular with illustrations of top-down views of ships and squadrons. Maybe to be sold as a box set like a board game.\n\nThe intention then became to design and hire an artist to create these sheets and then have them pre-cut board game style. It never came to fruition.\n\n**Campaign and Scenarios**\n\nThe intention was always to write a narrative-driven campaign that would go along with these rules.\nEither hex map driven or just a series of scenario tables based on game outcomes. Creating a two-player campaign could be easy with some tweaking to the maps and RU count.  I think it could be very easily implemented, and I still plan on doing that as a creative project in the future. I have scenario outlines already. \n\nI also would love to create a one-player narrative campaign with a slow-grow aspect in the future against an A.I. antagonist.  Like story mode in the Homeworld games.\n \n**Theme**\n\nThe intention was always to build a Homeworld game. I love the setting and the music, I love the RTS style of this game. I thought that if I couldn\u2019t use that IP, what I would need is a generic spaceship game. I had even gone as far as creating a distinct setting but lost interest in that as Homeworld was what drew me to make this game. \nYou\u2019ll notice the rules are written as model agnostic, but the fleet decks provided in the book are specific towards Homeworld 2. Somewhere along the process, I realized that I was never going to sell this, so I just started using Homeworld assets.\n\nUsing the base rules, you could make this game any theme you wanted or expand to create more navies in the Homeworld setting. \n \n**It\u2019s Ours Now**\n\nThis was a fun project that I\u2019ve been tinkering with in the background for a few years. It is nowhere near a complete product. I\u2019ve always wanted to share it and see if it would become something more than I could make it. Over the last few years, I\u2019ve had kids and work, and I can see now that I won\u2019t be able to give this game any real progress in the next few years. I want to give it to the community and let others pick up the torch if they\u2019d like to tinker.\n\nI\u2019m by no means a visual designer, artist, or even a game design specialist.\nWhat I am is a huge fan of the Homeworld series who also happens to be a tabletop wargamer who is a bit of a rules junky and has been playing wargames for over 20 years.\nI just wanted to see Homeworld on the table, and I wanted it to be awesome. I think I\u2019ve done that part at least at my house.\n\nI\u2019d be very happy to see better-designed fleet decks. Designed chits and tokens (I 3D printed generic off of Thingiverse), and of course updates to the rules, navies, and a campaign. I'll continue to work on this game as a hobby, I might add my model STL files to the drive.", "subreddit": "homeworld"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

I, like everyone else on reddit, play video games, not very picky when it comes to what exactly, usually open to trying most games. What I choose to play on my own differs from what I play with other people, usually up for anything coop or survival.\n\nWhen it comes to music, I mostly listen to electronic stuff (Madeon, Porter Pobinson, ODESZA, Flume, etc). But I do occasionally like a random song that isn\u2019t what I usually listen to. \n\nSci-Fi movies are always to the to-go for me, I am both a star wars fan and a trekkie. Other movies I love are Interstellar, Arrival and LOTR, Scott pilgrim vs the world and others. I also love a good mystery/thriller.\nNot the biggest anime fan but I watch one every once in a while.\n\nI am also a huge space nerd (super unique, right?) in general and know a lot of space facts that aren\u2019t very helpful to anyone but are fun to know anyway.\n\nI like to read, mostly non-fiction books, (Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, etc) and also psychology books. But I have been looking for a good fiction book recently so hit me up with recs.\n\nThats it for all the surface level stuff, gonna keep some things about myself off the post so you can get to know me. :)\n\nI have started traveling recently so i am also looking for someone who would be willing to do that, looking to visit Japan and/or South Korea within the next year.

That kind of passion inspires me. Hopefully you are someone who lives in/near LA or SD but I am down for LDR as long as we end up meeting. Also please be someone who actively participates in the conversation and is inquisitive and asks questions, if you are going to just sit there and have me ask you everything, then maybe it wont work out.\n\nNow a couple of things that kinda matter:\n1. I don\u2019t have a problem with religion but you should know that I am atheist snd prefer someone who is the same or agnostic.\n2. Please actually have something in common with me in terms of interests mentioned above. I have had way too many conversations with people here where it felt like I was pulling teeth because we did not actually have anything in common. Surprisingly, common interests are important for successful relationships!\n\nI should also mention i lean left politically and would appreciate someone along those lines.\n\nSomeone between the ages of 23-30 would be nice, but I might be ok with a year older or younger.\n\nI wont be responding to accounts that are less then 4 months old, sorry :( but i will provide pics if you do as well :)\n\nSo yeah, hit me up and if we hit it off and get to know each other, we can add eachother on discord later :)\n\nWould be great if you message me with a small intro about yourself :)", "subreddit": "r4r"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

I noticed the other day that Gameloft made an awesome quality of life update which now allows us the ability to freely move around the Harmony Stones after all this time. I got to thinking about a couple quality of life changes that I'd like to see introduced to the game since I'm in love with playing it and would really appreciate anything introduced that makes playing the game even more enjoyable. Feel free to add some of your ideas in the comments or expand upon some of mine, maybe one day someone from Gameloft will see this and consider some of these changes!\n\n  \n**THE ABILITY TO EASILY PLAY ON MANY DEVICES:**\n\nHas anyone here ever found it disappointing that you're basically locked into playing the game on one device at a time? Or when the time comes to move devices you more often than not have to deal with the task of doing a data transfer through Gameloft's support? I feel like those issues could be resolved by letting us have actual accounts similarly to other mobile games like Clash of Clans where you're able to play on many devices through an official Supercell account without worry of data loss.\n\n  \n**LAYOUT EDITOR OVERHAUL:**\n\nI've been wanting to redesign my Ponyville layout along with some of the other areas, but I'm constantly put off by the fact that moving it all around is a very tedious process since not all the structures can't be put into storage while editing. I know I already mentioned another mobile game by the name Clash of Clans above, but the way their base layout editor works is really nice and I would love to see Gameloft take some notes from them by adding the ability to have 3 or more savable layouts per town that you can switch between at any given moment, as well as the ability to put EVERYTHING on the map into storage while editing but not let you save that layout until all of the essential structures have been placed. I would also love the addition of a grid that can be toggled on and off while editing as well to help with symmetrical builds. This would make creating our towns so much more user friendly and fun for just about everyone.\n\n  \n**AN EASIER WAY TO LOCATE DESTRUCTIBLE OBSTACLES:**\n\nThis one's not that big of an annoyance most of the time, but sometimes can be. But I think there should be a way to instantly locate any clearable obstacles that randomly spawn around the map. Whenever there's a quest for removing obstacles and you tap the green arrow it will instantly send you to a random one. I feel like that function should be available outside of tapping the green arrow on those specific quests and turned into a feature similar to the timed auto collect offered by Dr. Hooves or something? I know I can't be the only one who ends up randomly finding small rocks and bushes hidden behind a structure when I go to move it and then having to wait for it to be destroyed or skipping with gems while in the middle of organizing stuff. These obstacles get  especially harder to locate the bigger your town grows.\n\n  \n**MORE SONGS FROM THE SHOW ADDED INTO GAME:**\n\nI'm only considering this a quality of life change because I'm sure many people still playing this game would love to listen to more than just the same 5 Equestria Girls tracks every time, that's not to say the songs are bad or anything so don't mistake it as that, it's just that there's tons of other great songs that should be added to the dancing minigame. Also, some more background tracks playing across the different locations would be greatly appreciated too!", "subreddit": "MLPIOS"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

Of course, they asked about magical tattoos, and discovered that such things exist, but they're typically reserved for those that find \"favor\" with the couatl, like priests, warriors, and devotees.

Ok, so maybe it isn't that great a time to be a fan of Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThat being said, I've been a fan of this franchise for far too long to let the intrusive thoughts win and I won't let morale tank without a fight. So, I'm gonna do what I'm best at doing: talking about bulk. Because when you're chasing commons, every pack is a god pack.\n\nTwo months ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1gu8dz0/ten_best_surging_sparks_cards_investor_bros_dont/) going over the best bulk of *Surging Sparks* to get people to care about bulk as much as I do and now's as good a time as any to do the same with *Prismatic Evolutions*. To the surpise of nobody, PRE is a set designed from the ground up to be pulled for hits first and foremost. Hot ticket SIRs, low pull rates, and a whole lot of reprints! This certainly isn't a *151* or a *Shrouded Fable* with their fresh array of bulk. HOWEVER that doesn't mean we're out of options! PRE does feature a mix of cards off the *Starter Set Generations* for us to sink our teeth into, alongside what fresh faces we did get in *Terastal Festival ex*. With that we've got more than enough to sink our teeth into, so let's dive right in...\n\n  \n**10. Seaking**\n\n[Illus. Nelnal](https://preview.redd.it/z0h5bqsm9fde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeba96070c5b9b46dcdb4c6b1fbbbf2fc7df222c)\n\n*Twilight Masquerade* ought to be remembered as the best SV Era set to date for its excellent assortment of bulk cards that make every pack a delight to open. One such card was [saino misaki's Goldeen](https://www.serebii.net/card/twilightmasquerade/044.shtml) with its wonderful festive theming that fit right in with the region of Kitakami. Well Goldeen got reprinted in *Terastal Festival ex* and it came paired with a brand new Seaking from Nelnal that keeps the party going with its warm purples and oranges. A literal splash of blue cools down the piece to the perfect temp, rounding out another great print for this underrated koi...\n\n  \n**9. Hippowdon**\n\n[Illus. Kurata So](https://preview.redd.it/m2j5auo0bfde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a6d130639d6789d32bdbc5a65e88b8a807ec76c)\n\nKnow the work rules: Tyranitar setting sand is a well-rounded design and a healthy part of a balanced meta. Hippowdon setting sand is a toxic part of a luck based, broken meta (my lawyer is informing me that my Stunfisk is leaking out again and I should stop this joke). Kurata So has made a name for themselves since debuting in *Crown Zenith* with their lineless style and subtle texture work that give all their pieces a playful aura about them. So's hippo is also noteworthy for being one of the more casual prints of this behemoth who is usually portrayed in a much more active stance and I always love when artists show us sides of Pok\u00e9mon that we don't normally seen. Honorable mention to [HYOGONOSUKE's Hippopotas](https://www.serebii.net/card/starterdeckgenerations/066.shtml) which is also pretty good, but I think two hippos is a little much for this list...\n\n  \n**8. Budew**\n\n[Illus. Yoriyuki Ikegami](https://preview.redd.it/rhmx39zwcfde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=5315501bd0b91db3f9c657c8cafbab90c2eec4b4)\n\nThe last time Budew printed I was 7 years old and just getting into Pok\u00e9mon for the first time. Now I'm a 20-something who gets way too invested in scribbles on cardboard. Yoriyuki Ikegami has been making waves since they exploded onto the scene in *Crown Zenith*, though it feels like so much longer. There's no better person to illustrate the return of this elusive bud though, as Ikegami's floral scenes are unmatched and Budew here is no exception. This should hold us over for the next 15 years...\n\n  \n**7. Lopunny**\n\n[Illus. Tika Matsuno](https://preview.redd.it/gjcimij5efde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=099fbbdfb5b29d60089d999d35f61ce87985cdef)\n\nHear me out.\n\nTika Matsuno is one of those names that might not be the flashiest artists in the business, but has racked up a surprisingly solid resume since debuting in *Darkness Ablaze*. Her knack for snow seasons and soft whites have resulted in many great pieces over the years, and you can add Lopunny to that list. Lopunny's brown and... cream coloration certainly don't blend in with the snow, but Matsuno holds the piece together with warm red highlights on the snow itself and some scattered white flurries across Lopunny that blend everything together in a way that allows both foreground and background to fuse into a card that makes me feel warm, even on cold, winter nights such as this one. Snow has never felt so comforting...\n\n  \n**6. Exeggcute**\n\n[Illus. Iori Suzuki](https://preview.redd.it/nre6gv5rffde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=7160080378085feed5135ad01ff8e0ae94d4460d)\n\nFor fear of putting too many bugs on my *Surging Sparks* list, I left off poor [Scatterbug](https://www.serebii.net/card/surgingsparks/005.shtml) while keeping its evolutions. I deprived myself the opportunity to talk about debut artist Iori Suzuki, and with their Leafeon from *Terastal Festival ex* being reserved as a Promo I don't get to talk about that either. That's fine though because you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs... too soon? Exeggcute is always a fun and challenging Pok\u00e9mon to interpret and Suzuki does pretty good here. The piece offsets the stiff nature of these snoozing misfits with a less than subtle camera tilt and slight low-angle perspective that give us just enough view of the sky our one awake soldier is staring off at. The piece comes together to give us the kind of up close and personal glimpse into the lives of these Pok\u00e9mon that makes these cards so great, and make you stop to think about things like what these little guys were doing to tire them out. My guess is playing tennis...\n\n  \n**5. Espeon**\n\n[Illus. Kariya](https://preview.redd.it/7g3qm11ahfde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d6a94823fef3ccb52c28fc96eac75ebb8aef85b)\n\nTo salt an already painful wound, *Prismatic Evolutions* removed all but two of the original Eeveelutions in this set to set aside as promos. I am distraught, but it makes this list a lot more interesting. Espeon and Umbreon were the two survivors of this purge, and good thing too. Espeon has always been a favorite Eeveelution of mine, and Kariya is able to perfectly mix the elegance of this Pok\u00e9 with a relaxed posture that equally shows off its lazy side. The exquisite detailing on the furniture gives us a glimpse into the kind of abode our subject calls home, and one can't help but envision what grandeur the rest of the place displays. Surely only the best for the best...\n\n  \n**4. Houndoom**\n\n[Illus. kawayoo](https://preview.redd.it/y5zprejkifde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=584d341091821f5c9a18366059b85ed5c49b9d6e)\n\nI'm so glad we're finally getting kawyoo's Houndoom off of *Starter Set Generations*. Taking the same energy as [Mightyena](https://www.serebii.net/card/twilightmasquerade/114.shtml) from *Twilight Masquerade*, kawayoo once more brings us up close and personal to this menacing Dark-type that (for what it's worth) doesn't seem all too pleased that you're here. Simply put, its another great piece from one of the best names in the franchise's history...\n\n  \n**3. Spritzee**\n\n[Illus. ryoma uratsuka](https://preview.redd.it/8o8jhx3cjfde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=d079d44c74fb7ea8480c045c0131c213f4956eb2)\n\nOk. I know nothing's gonna match up to Budew's 15 year absence, but at almost 6 years, Spritzee is basically equivalent. For context, the last time this Pok\u00e9mon printed, it was a Fairy-type. Man those were the days. I like myself pieces with strong contrast in its colors, but sometimes you just have to go all in with one. The strong pinks of this piece are balanced out with some subtle purples to help with the shading and a bright white light and outline that keep the balance of the piece while letting the many, MANY pinks shine through. Should also throw it out there that the artist behind the piece ryoma uratsuka has officially drawn all the Spritzee since they debuted in *Unified Minds* (one set after the Sprtizee line last appeared)...\n\n  \n**2. Noibat**\n\n[Illus. Masako Tomii](https://preview.redd.it/017x89vmkfde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=c93bd6defb84f242ef636434ca467486c37f0ec8)\n\nThere are two types of best cards in the TCG. The first are cards like Spritzee that take an aspect of a Pok\u00e9mon, crank it up to 11 and highlight it at its best. The second are those that take Pok\u00e9mon in new directions that somehow still feel like they fit the ethos of the Pok\u00e9mon. Noibat falls squarely in that second camp. *Obsidian Flames* alum Masako Tomii gives us a rarely seen moment of tranquility with this frequent flyer as it settles down cozy in a tree to snack on a recently procured Oran Berry (Bon Appetit!). The piece blends flat shading with a calming array of blues, greens and purples that almost camouflage the little bit into its surroundings when paired with the purple hues of the sky behind it. This further sells the idea of this being a hiding place from predators of some kind, though its sharp yellow eyes keep it from blending in too much with its surroundings and giving us plenty to admire. Bro looks like he's about to have the time of his life...\n\n  \n**1. Sylveon**\n\n[Illus. MINAMINAMI Take](https://preview.redd.it/lzigkm6zlfde1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d2f9d6b40d9b8dcf2946809c43a86f792cfad2a)\n\nMuch like with Leafeon, [Susumu Maeya's Sylveon](https://www.serebii.net/card/terastalfestivalex/068.shtml) also got cut for promos. However, we were not to be Sylveon-less as once again *Starter Deck Generations* comes to the rescue. Sylveon already had a great 2024, stealing the show in *Shrouded Fable*, and its starts off 2025 just as strong. MINAMINAMI Take continues to make their case for being the best new artist in the SV era with a fun piece full of soft blues, reds, and greens given dynamic life through a slight camera tilt and the flapping of Sylveon's tendrils (I said what I said). The directionality of the piece drags you in towards Sylveon's infectious smile making this one a shoo-in to spread that grin over to your own face. I know this set has a lot of Eevees to look for, but I know which one I'm pulling for...\n\n  \nWith all of that, we come to a close on *Prismatic Evolutions*. Like I said, kind of a lighter set artwise, but we'll see how I feel about the whole thing once I pry some packs from the hands of a crying child (little brat should stop going goo goo ga ga and instead going goo goo go get a job to afford this hobby). I hope I helped convince you that bulk is great and worthy of your attention as much as the bigger pulls are. Let me know which bulk card from this set is your favorite and which card you think I should have highlighted here. Packs cost a lot of money, but browsing bulk is free. \n\nAnd remember, like I said at the start, when you're chasing commons, every pack is a god pack.", "subreddit": "PokemonTCG"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

When the germans invade in 1939, The **allies have an Immediate intervention** and Poland requests soviet aid, which was surprisingly responded with a declaration of war to Berlin and ***Interveining in with the allies.*** This was possible due to ***trotsky Disliking the Far-right regime*** in germany, and viewing it as a **threat to the people and communism.** but, of course the soviet's aid was not for free, no matter how much the USSR could love Poland.

Inspired by LTN/Cybersyn\n\n**Not a full tutorial, but some pointers for those who want to venture down the same rabbit hole!** I don't have a fully functional system yet, but I've tested the components and found solutions (mods) for most challenges.\n\n**Mods Needed:**\n\n* [CircuitLaunchableRockets](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/CircuitLaunchableRockets)\n* [osha\\_container\\_signals](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/osha_container_signals)\n* [logistic-group-combinator](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/logistic-group-combinator)\n\n**Optional Mod:**\n\n* [AAI-Industries: Signal Transmission](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-signal-transmission)(Optional)\n\n**The Goal: Magical Deliveries from Nauvis Mall to Vulcanus**\n\nThe dream: requesting stuff for example on Vulcanus and having it magically delivered from my Nauvis mall, without any extra clicks. This could be triggered by building ghosts or personal logistic requests.\n\n**Challenges and Solutions:**\n\n**1. Automatic Requests from Nauvis:**\n\nVanilla Factorio doesn't let you automatically request items based on signals from another planet. Mods to the rescue!\n\n* I tried the Logistic Group Combinator, but requests weren't fulfilled because the signal likely lacked the \"import from\" info a manually set hub request has.\n* So, automatic requests are out. We need to manually request items on Nauvis and place them in the silo.\n\nTo send signals across planets, you can use the AAI Signal Transmission mod, or exploit the Logistic Group Combinator's nature by setting a constant combinator to the dynamic logistic group.  \nI use a memory cell with reset to save items as \"delivered\" and subtracted them from the request.\n\n**2. Launching the Silo Rocket Automatically**\n\nThis is where the CircuitLaunchableRockets mod comes in! Send a signal to launch a rocket to your hauler platform if specific conditions are met.\n\n**3. Knowing When the Silo is Full**\n\nThe Container Signals mod lets you read the grams used in a container, so you can decide when to launch (e.g., above 80% full, requests fulfilled, or 100% full).\n\n**4. Sending Off the Space Platform**\n\nI used the Logistic Group Combinator again. Placed a constant combinator on the platform with a special logistic group containing a silo as a \"GO\" signal (An item is needed, and a silo is something we wouldn't fit in a rocket.), wired it to the hub and used it as a condition\n\n**5. Sending the Hauler Back**\n\nI set requests in the cargo landing pad on the target planet. Once everything is delivered, the hauler will send items down and return to Nauvis (using all requests fulfilled condition).\n\n**Probable Bugs:**\n\nI foresee issues with items getting stuck in the inserter's hand as the silo fills up. It might place them back in the request chest, but the memory cell might already have saved them as \"delivered\" and subtracted them. We'll see!\n\n**What do you think?

As they walk down the winding forest path, Lila feels a lingering unease stemming from her childhood traumas but is excited about the fun time she will have with Emma.\n\n**Chapter 2: Safe Haven**\n\nUpon arrival, Emma and Lila settle in, unpacking their belongings and lighting a campfire to share stories. The silence of the forest is only interrupted by the occasional sound of wildlife. As the sun sets, they savor the moment of their strengthened friendship.\n\n**Chapter 3: The Whisper of Threat**\n\nAs the night progresses, they start hearing strange noises outside the house. Initially, they assume the sounds are just the normal noises of the forest, but soon they realize the noises are becoming more distinct and eerie. Looking out the window, they see a shadow moving in the darkness.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Face of Danger**\n\nVictor Kane, a psychopath, manages to sneak into the house. Awakened by the noises, Lila and Emma realize that Victor is a limitless danger lurking in the shadows nearby. Victor has lost his sanity due to a traumatic event he once experienced in these woods.\n\n**Chapter 5: The Fight for Survival**\n\nVictor begins to threaten the girls both physically and psychologically.

{"post": {"title": "Ever Played a Map Bigger Than 'Extra Large' in HoMM V? Now you can! [Showcase of my custom map and solutions to popular RMG maps problems] ", "id": "1i31cpf", "created_utc": 1737066825.0, "selftext": "Hey everyone! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI wanted to share something I\u2019ve been working on for a while: a custom map for Heroes of Might and Magic V called The Ultimate Conflict. If you\u2019re into epic, long-lasting games with tons of exploration, battles, and hero-building, this map is for you. I\u2019ve poured a lot of time into making it unique, balanced, and just plain fun to play. Plus, I\u2019ve included a bonus version of the map for those who want an even crazier challenge!\n\nWhy You Should Check This Out\n\n1. It\u2019s HUGE:\nThe map is \u201cimpossible\u201d in size, which is the largest possible in Heroes V. If you love massive maps where you can really take your time to explore, build up your heroes, and conquer everything, this is perfect for you. Reaching level 30+ is pretty common here, so you can create some truly insane heroes.\n\n2. 8 Unique Biomes:\nEach player starts in their own biome, designed specifically for their faction. Every faction has access to its best resources and units, so it\u2019s balanced but still challenging. There\u2019s also a neutral biome with a magical grass texture (think Conflux from Heroes III), filled with elemental recruitment buildings and Dragon Utopias. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you can build an elemental army or just grab some crazy loot.\n\n3. Shipyards for Every Town:\nEver been annoyed that you can\u2019t build a shipyard, hence never having your town fully upgraded, even with the Grail? I fixed that. Every town on this map starts with access to water, which opens up new strategies and challenges.\n\n4. Three Towns per Biome:\nEach biome has three towns, so there\u2019s plenty of room to expand and build your empire.\n\n5. Faction-Specific Artifacts:\nEach biome has at least one Pendant of Mastery and a special set of artifacts tailored to that faction. This means you can fully develop your hero and make them as powerful as possible.\n\n6. Memory Mentor with a Twist:\nThere\u2019s one Memory Mentor on the map, but here\u2019s the fun part: every player has a portal leading to it. If multiple players show up at the same time, it turns into an all-out brawl. The portals also give access to all biomes in the late game, but only after you defeat the strong guards protecting them. If the game doesn\u2019t roll the skills you want, this gives you a chance to fix it\u2014but you\u2019ll have to fight for it.\n\n7. Bonus Version of the Map:\nI\u2019ve included a second version of the map called The Ultimate Hero Conflict, where you start with the strongest campaign heroes instead of the standard ones. If you want to spice things up even more, this version is for you.\n\nFixing Problems You Didn\u2019t Know You Had\n\n1. Crash Fix for Large Maps:\nDid you know that Heroes V can crash when playing on maps larger than \u201cExtra Large\u201d after a while or when loading a save? This happens because the game hits its memory limit (3-4GB). To fix this, you can use the 4GB Patch, which allows the game to use more RAM. You can grab it here:\n\ud83d\udc49 [4GB Patch](https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/) \nJust apply the patch to your Heroes V executable file, and the crashes should stop. I\u2019ve tested it myself, and it works perfectly.\n\n2. Speeding Up AI Turns:\nIf you\u2019ve ever played a large map with 8 players, you know how painfully slow the AI turns can get in the late game. To fix this, I recommend using the Quantomas AI Mod, which makes the AI turns waaaaay faster without changing the game\u2019s balance. You can download it here:\n[\ud83d\udc49 Quantomas AI Mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/quantomas-ai)\nThis mod is based on the improved AI used in Heroes 5.5, but without any of the balance changes. It\u2019s still being actively developed, and many players say it\u2019s even better than the Heroes 5.5 AI.\n\nHow to Install the Map\n\n1. Download the map from here:\n[\ud83d\udc49 Download The Ultimate Conflict \ud83d\udc48](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1txdVG03S2J-bwvgWi2MuEhwqGv9FKpaY?usp=sharing)\n\n2. Move the files \u201cThe_Ultimate_Conflict.h5m\u201d or \u201cThe_Ultimate_Hero_Conflict.h5m\u201d to the \u201cMaps\u201d folder in your Heroes V installation directory. For example:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Heroes of Might and Magic 5 Tribes of the East\\Maps If your system is in a different language, the path might look a little different.\n\n3. Launch the game, go to the custom game menu, and look for a button with the \u201cRMG\u201d tag. This tag means the map was originally created with the random map generator. Once you turn this button on you\u2019ll see the map on the list and can start playing.\n\nWhy I Think You\u2019ll Love This Map\n\nI made this map because I wanted something that felt epic, balanced, atmospheric and fun, while also solving some of the annoying issues that come with large maps in Heroes V. Whether you\u2019re playing solo or with friends, this map has something for everyone. It\u2019s packed with unique features, tons of exploration, and plenty of opportunities to build the ultimate hero.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fresh Heroes V experience, give it a try! And if you do, let me know how it goes\u2014I\u2019d love to hear your feedback or see how your games turn out. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI fixed so many issues with this map already that right now I can't think of anything more that might need my attention. In my head the map is done, playable and super fun. It's a little scary for me if any one of you might find a bug. \ud83d\udc80 But if you do please comment so I can fix it. \n\nHave fun, and may your heroes become legends! \ud83d\udee1\u2728", "subreddit": "HoMM"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

SK Survivors is currently looking for players! We are a relatively young guild, having been founded roughly 20 months ago! We are a group of competitively oriented players of all different progression levels (above 1 mil - 10 mil gp) and experience! Our goal is to progress together and build a guild as strong as possible, yet knowing and being aware that there's a life outside the game! We're currently looking for 2 players to round out our roster a little!\n\nOur current stats:\n\u2022 301 mil GP\n\u2022 64-23 TW record, 13 full clears\n\u2022 RotE 16 \u2b50\n\u2022 Geo DS TB 30 \u2b50 and growing as we grow, around 30-35 WAT shards per run (varies a bit)\n\u2022 Naboo Raid, obtaining 3rd reward box!\n\u2022 On top of that we offer a discord server with a fun and welcoming environment and lots of group knowledge. This game is much more fun in a great group, working together and having a blast!\n\nWhat we are looking for:\n\u2022 Currently players of 5+ mil gp, if possible 2 GLs but 1 GL + a built out roster might be okay as well!\n\u2022 A somewhat balanced roster besides the LSBs, some core teams\n\u2022 Preferably G12+ Geos\n\u2022 600 raid tickets a day\n\u2022 Full TW/TB participation (missing for example the odd TB phase is not an issue, we just want general participation)\n\u2022 Joining our discord server (to at least communicate about event strategies and guild issues; communication beyond that is hoped for but not necessary)\n\nIf you are interested in joining or have any questions please don't hesitate to DM me!

{"post": {"title": "Resources, charities, fun facts about sloth mating ", "id": "1i318p3", "created_utc": 1737066534.0, "selftext": "The second is an image which shows the next fun fact. Sloths are normally very solitary and usually don't even share a tree with another sloth. The only time they share a living space is when they are a baby or a mother with a new baby. The babies learn to climb by climbing the fur of their mother. When the babies are big enough they find their own tree traveling through the canopy. When a female three toed sloth is in heat she climbs as high as she can, and screams, at intervals as short as 15 minutes. The males in the area get excited and find her tree. The two toed sloths instead secrete pheromones which they rub on trees. The only time (that I know of) that sloths fight is over mating rights. \"Despite two-fingered sloths having been bred successfully in zoos, sloth copulation itself is rarely witnessed and there is little known about the act. Footage has shown sloths mating in all different orientations; hanging upside down, front to back, face to face, hanging precariously from branches\u2026 sloths do it any way they like.\" - The Sloth Conservation Foundation. They don't know much about the mating of three toed sloths who have yet to mate in captivity. Apparently the fighting over mating rights can continue for days because even though they are usually done copulating in about a minute, they do try frequently. The male rarely stays the night, usually choosing a different tree. It sounds a lot like Tinder \ud83d\ude09\n\nIt's not unheard of to see sloths together in a tree but it's pretty rare outside of mating and growing up. Apparently many two toed sloths that have mated in captivity are due to the fact that a through examination wasn't done - because their generation look very similar. So they think they have two females or two males in an enclosure but they end up with a mating pair.\n\nAnyway picture number 2 is a screenshot of the Sloth Conversation Foundations website where you can support their work and get cute gifts at the same time. You can also download free ebooks for preschool and then middle grades children at the website.\n\nThis post is mostly to let you all know that you should get to know about Lucy Cooke. She's a zoologist and has taken a lot of fantastic sloth photos like the one I'm showing here from last year's catalog. This year I got a new one because my partner supports my love of sloths. \n\nAnyway Lucy has written 3 books on sloths and included them in a fourth. She's got a Ted Talk on them (which I haven't seen yet). And she's founded the sloth appreciation society.\n\nFrom the reading I've done only the Sloth Conversation Foundation has a good rep. They do tons of projects to preserve the habitats that Sloths need and they do original research. The Sloth Institute was apparently a scam. There are a lot of places where they want people to pay them to take pictures holding a sloth, most of which have been poached. \n  \nI haven't read the books because I only remembered that she had the one with more animals in it. I'll be adding them to my reading list and I'll keep reporting up to the minute important sloth information. That's probably inaccurate. I'll keep reporting sloth fun facts  when I've got the energy.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Cooke\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1hd4BrFhRKXtvklV5snnGyj/why-we-should-all-live-like-a-sloth\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3sJeljVQU  ", "subreddit": "sloths"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

It would be a place where anyone can pitch to an audience (aka the twitter followers), make potential connections, and maybe even land their first customers.\n\nHuge ponzi scheme but I think it'd be beneficial to the space aha.\n\nThe account will grow with people who love hearing pitches or are looking for cool opportunities, and over time, it could turn into a great spot to get feedback, meet the right people, and see which ideas actually take off.\n\nIf you have an idea or already shot a YC video applications, DM me and I\u2019ll upload it. Let\u2019s see what happens :)\n\nP.S: Also open to any feedback & tell me if you think it's relevant\n\nP.P.S: If you want to see this, check [griftcombinator on twitter](https://x.com/griftcombinator)", "subreddit": "indiehackers"}, "sentiment": "positive"}

Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week, okay?\nUh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, \"Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.\"\n\nBlah, blah, blah. Now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.\n\nSo, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh... something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?\n\nUh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll pr- they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to... forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort... and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.\nY-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power.

So.. you see where I may be going with this.. in my made up qualifications of what makes you a god Technoblade qualifies under the did something incredible for a group of people quota because he raised a crap ton of money for cancer research and Technodad continues to raise money in his honor\u2026 so in by made up qualifications for this position that he definitely rightfully deserves I dub \u201cAlexander TechnoBlade\u201d The God of Charity!
