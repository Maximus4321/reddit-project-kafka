Then they had my sibling and divorced a few years later. \n\nIn a conversation recently, he said:\n\n\"You know, there's a lot of women in the Philippines.\" \n\nThat's the first thing he said to me that struck me as a red flag. \n\n\"Oh yeah,\" I asked, my interest piqued, \"What do you mean?\" \n\n\"I mean the Philippines has a lot of attractive women- Thailand too.\" \n\n\"Uh.. okay.\" \n\n\"I'm thinking about moving there.

I'd probably be able to just live pretty comfortably off of my rentals if I moved there.\"\n\nFor context- my dad went to prison when I was a kid. Basically right after my mom divorced him.  Him and his friends were selling a decent volume of drugs. He started talking to his second wife while in prison, and was released just before the 2008 mortgage meltdown. The two of them married and began to buy cheap foreclosed homes and became landlords. He also started selling again, but only weed. \n\n\nFast forward to the present, when this conversation took place: He is 46, recently went through his second divorce and is still responsible for my two half-brothers. One has just started high school and the other is about to be in middle school. My dad doesn't work, and spends much of his time staring at his stock trading software and watching finance-bros on YouTube. \n\n\"Oh. Sounds cool,\" I said with no enthusiasm, alarm bells ringing in my head. \n\n\"That, and I'm tired of the women here. I wouldn't be moving there JUST to meet women of course. I'd be going with an open mind to experience a new culture and country, but the women- the women in those Asian countries are more traditional than the ones here which would be nice.\"\n\nAt this point, my chronically online ass knows the direction this is headed. \n\n\"What do you mean by traditional?\" I asked, wanting him to elaborate further.\n\n\"I dunno, I mean they're more modest, loyal, not always on social media- I think really it's social media that makes the women here the way they are. Selfish. Conceited. And with constant access to other men and vice versa\" \n\n\"I don't know, dad there's a lot of women here too you know. \n\n\"Yeah I know.\" \n\n\"So maybe it's more a matter of just needing to meet more of them.\" \n\n\"I dunno... Well I've been trying dating apps, and when I set my location to the Philippines, I almost instantly get matches. There's this girl I've been talking to on there lately actually. It just seems like she has a whole different mindset from women here. I don't think it will be anything serious because I want to keep my options open- I'm pretty sure I'll never get married again, even if I do move to one of those places. I'll just... 'make a fun time!' \". He said that last bit with some kind of mock middle eastern accent and then laughed. \n\n\"Well, I'm not sure you need to move to another country to have that happen.\" I said, grossed out.\n\n\"Maybe not, but my money would go a lot further in those countries, so I think my odds would be much better. Plus, if I keep playing the stock market- keep learning about it, I can have that to fall back on if I end up with vacancies. My goal is to have it to where I'm a day trader, you know. But they say it takes about as much time as going to university to get really good at it, Somewhere around 4 years.\" \n\nHe then began to tell me about the YouTubers that he had been watching who led him down this passport bro rabbit hole, and at that point it was very clear to me that he was indulging in the same escape fantasy many middle aged divorced men share. \n\nIt's disgusting, honestly. And that's what it is- an escape fantasy, which is the result of too much YouTube combined with the lack of interaction with other people, specifically women. Rather than viewing women as individuals with their own complex inner worlds, and viewing himself and his habits or behaviors as a potential obstacle to a relationship or even a hookup with one of those individuals, he'd rather look to blame the whole lot of them than do any self-reflection. \n\n", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I quit vaping and drinking alc a few months back and like a month ago I was on the phone with her and she was like \u201coh can you please buy me a vape\u201d and I was just like \u201cI quit vaping myself so no\u201d and hung up. And I hung out with her the other day and smoked wwed with her, I didn\u2019t have much to begin with, just enough to get high. I asked her to let me fill the bowls and she didn\u2019t listen. So I said okay just make sure you leave a bowls worth for me. When it was time to go she was like \u201cIf you want to smoke you can\u2019t it\u2019s all gone\u201d she literally finished off the weed when I was in the house. And last night when I was sleeping she called me about 4 times and kept texting me asking me to bring her to the gas station and buy her liquor. I\u2019m 21 she\u2019s not so I get she needs somebody. But this was at 10 pm and 3 am. so read the room and also no I\u2019m not gonna buy her shit bc I know she\u2019s not gonna pay back and even if she does I don\u2019t want to be used. Once my bf left her 2 grams of weed at my house on a front and me 3.5 grams just bc I\u2019m his gf and that time I had the weed separate, clearly it wasn\u2019t both hers. But she took both bags and it took like 7 months for her to pay me back after begging and begging. I hate being mean and asking for something as simple as just \u201chey please pay me back\u201d is difficult for me so I don\u2019t want to put myself in a situation where I have to ask or ask a lot you know. I think she just misses social ques or something. I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s purposely trying to take advantage of me, but bottom line is she is lowkey. I already blow her off 99% of the time bc of this and how she hasn\u2019t respected my boundaries in the past and it\u2019s just made me uncomfortable to where the only option is to just ignore her.

Today I want to talk about how social media is mostly fantasy. We see people every day posting on social media about their wonderful lives. They have the best clothes, designer bags, red bottom shoes. They live in big homes, have fancy cars, and go on luxury trips. Many of them are flashing big stacks of money in our faces.\nBut life is not always as it seems to be.\n\nIf we are not careful we will compare our reality to someone else's fiction. And the measuring stick we are using is not even real. \nRead that again! \nWhen will we stop putting these \u201cinfluencers\u201d on pedestals? When will we be okay with ourselves and what we have? When will peace be worth more than things?\n\nLook I get it, I grew up poor, and I wanted the good life. \nI ended up selling my soul for that life. I stayed in a verbally abusive marriage for 24 years. Yes, I had the house, the cars, the toys, the vacations, and the six-figure income. Everyone thought I had the perfect life yet I cried myself to sleep every night, miserable. \n\nMoney doesn't make you happy. Yet social media tells you it does.\nWhen honestly, do we know how many of these \u201cinfluencers\u201d have bill collectors at their door? How many of them are fronting how happy they are for the cameras? How many of these lives are fake? How many takes does it take for them to portray this perfect shot? \n\nWe don't know because they are only showing us what they want us to see. The final edited version of their \"perfect\u201d\nPlease remember that not everything is what it seems.\n\nIn writing my blog I am always honest, I tell it like it is. I fail, I fall down. I do stupid shit. This is real life, and come on people, not everyone has a perfect life. Look, if you're the one in a billion that does, good for you but the rest of us are just trying to make it through the shit storm of life. \n\nIt's no wonder this last generation has self-esteem issues. In the dinosaur days, we only had to look at magazines and for most of us who couldn't afford them it was once a week at the grocery store checkout line or on TV. It wasn't an every second bombarding of \"perfect\u201d people. It wasn't trolls making fun of us \u201cnormal\u201d people, putting people down, or just being that frigging cruel. We had one bully to deal with at school, today they have millions of bullies to deal with every second of the day. And then we wonder why these last two generations are so screwed up.\n\nSo today my friends remember not everything is what it seems. These \u201cinfluencers\u201d are lying to you and probably to themselves as well. They lie about products they use just to get paid for them, and they lie about their perfect lives, they are not perfect. No one is!             So when will we start getting real? When will we be brave enough to say I have flaws, I fall down, I am so not perfect, like I do every time I write this blog? Step out past your fears, be real, and allow yourself to be not perfect, trust me it feels amazing to live in your truth. \n\u201cBe the change you want to see\u201d\n", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

If you're upset I didn't use my uterus, oh well...so sad for you, but you don\u2019t get to force other women to procreate if we don't want to. Go use your own body for offspring. (By the way, my partner (57M) is also permanently childfree, so go off.) However, I think it's particularly cruel when women who DO want kids but are infertile are told they're not *really* a woman by these harpies. Seriously, back off of women who can't conceive, they're already suffering enough without your trashy opinion reminding them of their difficulties. \n\n**Only real women^TM understand the immense pain of having a monthly cycle.** Typically I have seen this most often used in a misandric way, to push the idea that males \"don't know pain\" or are inferior/weaker in some way because they don't have to deal with menstruation. But here's the thing...not all females do either! I've been having a period since I was 8 years old, and never once has it caused me any discomfort, pain, or irritating side effects like I hear the majority of females get. I don't have cramps, nausea, headaches, weird cravings, constipation, diarrhea, mood swings, etc. It's just 5 days of bleeding and some water retention, and that hasn't changed at all in the whole 35 years I've had it. I'm not alone either; apparently something like 10-12% of women are likewise unaffected by their cycle. Granted, this is a very small percentage of women in the grand scheme of things. But it's still *incredibly* annoying for holier-than-thou women to flaunt their period pain as a way to gatekeep.\n\nAnd lastly, only **real women^TM know their worth and would never pay on a date/pay for a man** crowd. This is a predominant way of thinking in my region, and it always makes me think these women are mentally stuck in the 1930s. Listen, if you're a woman who requires your man to pay for everything you do together...that's fine, so long as he's cool with it too. I get it, some women enjoy being financially kept and cared for. But for goodness sake, the idea that equalist women like me are \"too masculine\" or \"trying to emasculate our man\" just because we split the bills 50/50 is absurd. I've been told on 6 separate occasions that I'll \"never be enough of a woman\" for my boyfriend unless I stop paying for myself/stop paying my part of our home expenses. I find that pretty sexist to treat him like a wallet instead of my partner And I make more than him, so it makes sense that I pay more. We've been together for 20 years so it's not as if any of this is new to him. From what I can tell, men in general really like a partner who helps provide for the family rather than demanding he do all the work when he's already doing his best.

(Not that I'd get 0 scammers, mind you, just *relatively fewer*)\n\nWith the above in mind, I stopped using the site for a few weeks, so that the bots would \"mark\" me as \"inactive\" and I'd get fewer of them. \n\nI came back, and what do you know, the spam has thinned out a bit. I browsed the site a little bit just for kicks, looking for people that both match my interests and their profile looks real enough to try messaging them. \n\nWell, a few days later, I get a reply to one of my messages. It's another scammer, which is odd, given that scammers usually come to you rather than waiting for someone to send them a message. I played along for a bit, without giving personal info. When they started pushing me to give them (iirc) a check routing number, I decided to report it. \n\nImagine my surprise when the \"report\" button drop down menu, had a few options missing. You could no longer report fraud, spam or inappropriate images. Only more serious crimes or threats of violence. \n\nNow, I can understand if they didn't have the manpower to investigate everything that was reported. But, someone who is an admin of the site would have had to decide that they want to eliminate the option to report relatively minor infractions, then take the time to follow through with that.\n\nWhy wouldn't you want to at least have the *illusion* of giving a shift, from the user's perspective? Couldn't they reprogram the report scam / inappropriate image button, so that all is does is block that user from contacting you anymore? But just give you a message with an empty promise to \"look into it\"? Then the admins wouldn't have to *actually* give a duck, it would just *look like* it, but the users would be none the wiser.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

A lot of us employees were literally on all fours crawling to grab items we needed to fulfill the cart.......anyway because of that I shop Brick & Mortar stores and do everything I can to not buy online. Especially from Amazon.\n\nHowever, fast forward to now. I'm tired of not finding what I need in the stores. I'm tired of getting an additional surcharge for using my debit card. One time I really really wanted a pair of rollerblades and saw that Dunham's Sports had some. I went to a location. They didn't have it even though their online website said it's in stock at that particular location. They told me it was at another shop. i drove 15 mins to there. They didn't have it either...... Another instance, I went to Best Buy to buy a phone charger cable. I was gonna buy their private label brand, Insignia. Actually great products btw. Really wanted a charger cable. They DID NOT HAVE THAT IN STOCK EITHER! They dont have in stock their own private brand item. It was a 10 ft cable. They didn't have 6 ft which is what I would have settled for. Only 3 ft was available. That's way too short. Like it's so hard to support Brick & Mortar when nothing is ever in stock nor is anything you want actually in the store.\n\nAs much as I hate myself from doing it, both occasions I had to order from Amazon and I got it to me in the next day because I really needed the phone cable and the blades I could not find anywhere physically.

I hope the mall near me does not close down because there are talks and I'm doing my part but going there. If there is no mall, then where else are we supposed to hang out and have a good time to spend some social time while shopping.\n\nTL:Dr - Trying to support Brick & Mortar stores but everything is always out of stock or barely has variety products no matter how hard I have tried at multiple locations.

You can compare that to the average suicide rate of adults in the US, which is less than 1% ([Source](https://afsp.org/suicide-statistics/)). I say this not to downplay the nationwide suicide rate; my point is to emphasize just how catastrophically bad things are for trans people and trans youth in this country.\n\nYes, this is a bigger problem than trans women playing women's sports.\n\nYes, this is a bigger problem than transgender people using the bathroom that matches their gender identity.

I can't believe I even need to fucking spell that out for you.\n\nSo if you've spent more energy on the sports issue or the bathroom issue than you have on the suicide issue, if you've written more words on whatever social media platform is available to you about the sports / bathroom issues than you have about the hundreds of thousands of people who are trying to kill themselves, in large part because people like you say shit like that, then seriously, how fucked up are your priorities?\n\nTake a look at [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X18300855) that shows you very definitively how offering the most basic level of respect to a trans person improves their mental health outcomes significantly. You recognize their mental health issues and hopefully would like a solution, yes? Well here you fucking go. Call them by their chosen name, respect their identity, and their depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior will all go down. Here's [another study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9991447/) saying that the transgender youth with just one adult accepting their identity has a 39% lower risk of attempting suicide. Are you sure you can't just, like, get over yourself and be this person for someone else and save their life? Your own personal bigotry is just too important to you to offer that kind of life-saving intervention for someone?\n\nIf you become aware of this, and you still think to yourself, \"nah, I'm just going to continue being a dickhead and keep talking about these clearly less important issues and forego the opportunity to offer someone the basic respect of using their chosen name and respecting their identity and single-handedly reduce this person's risk of death by suicide\", then by all means, please, go fuck yourself. If you cannot do something THIS small to help your fellow human THAT much, then how much of a piece of shit ARE you at this point?\n\nI'm so sick of your bullshit saying that the reason they suffer is because of the dysphoria. You cannot deny that bullying is a major, major factor. You cannot deny that your lack of acceptance makes them feel more isolated. You just can't.

I am ok, I have a home of around 700k but with a mortgage of another 29 years. \n\nFrom time to time we will get into conversations about finances. He doesn't understand why people struggle to make ends meet. So I have to eventually tell him, that literally all my first paycheck go into my mortgage. and I survive with my 2nd paycheck. and we consider that I make pretty good money in this are.... i say to him. The mortgage company wants at least 30-40% debt to income to qualify anyone. If I didn't have extra passive income, I wouldn't have qualified for my home. Now, I said, tell me why people struggle. \n\nHe irritates me when we talk about money, and he will acknowledge it afterward, and tell me he gets it that he is a privileged white male. Sometimes though, I still feel like he doesn't understand. However, like today he complains that he has to make insurance payments for 5 cars he owns and he is broke.......\n\n  \nDUDE, you dont know what broke is. Like seriously.

I got the notification that my delivery arrived so I hobbled to my door and.... no groceries. I double checked the app and I looked closer at the proof of delivery picture.  Wasn't my place at all. \n\nNow again I'm disabled so going around to try to figure out which place they left my groceries was not possible.

People depend on GPS too much these days, and yes GPS has is merits, but you need to actually use your freaking eyes! At night time I can understand having some issues with seeing house/building numbers but for fricks sake it was broad daylight! Before my disability became so bad that I need to use mobility aids I used to delivery pizza... in the 90's. No GPS just a map and the ability to use my eyes so I know delivery isn't easy. This however.... this makes me so mad.

Everyone has big balls behind the computer screen. But get them in real life and they are pussys, who have no balls whatsoever to say that to a person's face. \n\nIt's so easy to put people down, to be disrespectful, or to show such hatred to others when there are no consequences. This is one of the horrible things that is happening in social media now. Maybe they don't see people as people with feelings anymore. Maybe it makes others feel better about their pathetic lives to put others down. Maybe everything is so fake on social media that people can't think of others' feelings. Whatever it is it really sucks. \n\nI would never be that unkind or disrespectful to anyone online or in real life. Do you think that person doesn't have feelings? Do you not think cruel comments affect people? Does making someone feel bad make you feel like a bigger person? What is it? Please explain it to me. Because I don't understand. \nI want to uplift people. I give compliments because I always choose to see the good in people. I don't ever want to purposely make another human being feel bad. That's just horrible, like seriously what is happening to this world? \n\nThere is a Facebook group from my hometown and this has to be the most horrible group ever. They are rude, ruthless, racist, and just terrible to everyone even if someone is just asking a question.\nThey even cut this lady to pieces when she was looking for her lost dog, seriously people, she lost her dog? \nI am ashamed that these people come from my hometown. Growing up there, we helped our neighbors, we loved one another despite their color, their religion, or their sexual preference. We were a neighborhood and it was incredible to grow up there. So it's sad to see so many people there being downright cruel to each other now. \n \nSo to these smucks on this Sullivan County site, get a dam life because most of the people on there need to get their ass kicked for what they say but of course, they wouldn't have enough balls to say this in real life.\n\nSocial media is getting worse and worse.

buying ingredients and resources (i get paid back- but i do this in my own hours), snd i often spend up to 2 hours a night doing unpaid work filling out paper work and planning and then on saturday i work as a music tutor so im always busy planning lessons there too. and during the summer as well as planning, i worked in restbite care 3-4 days a week\n\nso for 5 months we didn't go out on a date because i didn't plan them or pay for them. even after asking him, begging him, crying about how i was lonely (i haven't got any friends my last one stole \u00a3150 worth of stuff in front of me after i asked him not too, called me an asshole after i paid \u00a370 for a lunch i didn't want- and then hit me) and tired and fed up for the same routine and just wanna be spoiled like i was in the first few months- and it's not a matter of money. he earns \u00a33.5k-4k a month, and i earn \u00a31.4k a month. after tax that is. \n\nhe knows i have no friends and am trying to make friends. and i encourage him to spend time with his friends- but he's always organising and paying for them to go bowling, or out for drinks or to the cinema and i don't get invited ever- which is fine because it's his friends. but he doesn't do anything like that with me anymore; even after talking to him about it about 20 times in 6 months, and crying to him about it. \n\nhis own family have invited me to things, and he's then not told me i was invited because he \"didn't want me there\" or \"he's forgot\". his own family don't understand and neither do i. i miss out on family meals and parties and stuff because of him not telling me and they ask me after the fact why i didn't come when i had no idea why. \n\nfor christmas this year i got him a cookbook he really wanted that he mentioned back in may. it was a really nice one and then last weekend he told me i couldn't come over to visit on the sunday, because he was cooking for his family. \nhe's never cooked for me. so the one day i could see him because i work monday - saturday, again atm - he cooked for his family. from the cook book i got him. \n\nit wasn't always be like this. and believe me i don't like to keep notes of everything that goes wrong, or that he doesn't wrong and he does soooooo much right and he's such a kind and honest man and i love him and i can't see myself with anyone else but im so tired. im so tired of being second to everyone in life even when i put everyone else above me especially him. i just wanna be put first by someone for once in my life. \n\nrant over ", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Went down all the way to 200 lbs but was a college student working out like crazy with unlimited free time and the fountain of youth. Now about to be 24, weighing 250 lbs, diet fatigue has ruined me, and lack of daily steps has resulted in me developing an almost binging/anorexic disorder and now on the verge of self harm and drug use both doctor prescribed and black market. \n\n\nI come from a family of fat fucks. Fat fuck mom and dad. Fat fuck grandparents. Even Fat fuck extended family. Naturally, i got the Fat fuck genes. I was the tubby kid who could never take his shirt off in the pool. Never lean. Never was an eye catcher with girls in high school. Always had a double chin i have covered with a beard thankfully over time. Hated myself and even started my first diet at 16 when I weighed 230 lbs at 5'10\".\n\n\nI took a blue collar gig over the summer before college. I worked 14 hours a day 6 days a week and regulated me to pretty much fast food only with long commute hours. Despite hard manual labor, I gained weight unbelievably and weighed 260 lbs going into my freshman year of college. With motivation of scoring a girlfriend WAY out of my league at the time, i decided to make a change. \n\n\nI always idolized bodybuilders of various eras and finally started working out but the scale was going nowhere. I was on a dining plan in college and the dining hall served ZERO fresh food. All the meat was fried, GMO fruits, crappy steamed vegetables that tasted like eating a flip flop plus fries and pasta was a regular side. I tried counting calories but realized that even under 1600 calories, I didn't lose weight nor could I with the shitty options. \n\n\nI moved in with the girlfriend, got off the dining hall food, and began cooking at home. I increased my working out to 2 hours per day every day with an hour or more of martial arts classes per day. I skipped classes and homework to workout. 3 plus hours a day with over 12,000 steps. Still no scale movement! I went down 10 lbs and plateau'd in 7 months of doing this. \n\n\nI started a keto diet and then for the first time in my life, I lost weight. 6 months of keto, I lost 50 lbs and by January 2022, I weighed an even 200 lbs fairly lean. Was the happiest time in my life. Friends came to me with ease. People said yes to me more than no. Women treated me differently and at the time, I was single and got laid way more than I ever did. Jobs came to me with ease and I became the enforcer at martial arts. I was the one guy nobody had a chance at beating in a match.\n\n\nI kept it off....for awhile until graduate school. I began a wild master's degree where i did school work often for 12 hour days every day with tests weekly to graduate early. My diet fell apart and the only thing I felt kept my bodyweight down was making time to workout and biking about 6 miles a day over rugged hills to class, the gym, and back. \n\n\nBy graduation, I weighed 220 lbs, a 20 lb gain in 10 months and my little six pack i had vanaished.\n\n\nI started my corporate career where it became much harder to get a lot of steps. I went from 13K daily to 6K, even with 45 minutes of cardio. I lift weights daily and have for years but my scale started going nuts, eventually weighing 235 lbs. \n\n\nI went back to keto and it didn't work. I dropped a measly 5 lbs and plateau'd hard. This led to me starting a near starvation diet of a mixed bag of low fats, low carbs, and high protein yet I GAINED WEIGHT. This led to a near starvation attempt that worked. \n\n\nI always told myself I would never have an eating disorder but here I was. To make it worse, as I said, it worked and the scale FLEW down to 212 lbs in a matter of weeks. \n\n\nAt the time, I had been broken up with the other girlfriend for awhile and was really not on the market for awhile. I then started dating and met someone new. We went out a lot, traveled, and moved in together this past year but our fun has come at a cost. \n\n\nFrom February 2024 to November 2024, I gained all the way to 250 lbs and despite my lifting and working out, it's the sloppiest, pudgiest weight i feel I've ever had. \n\n\nThe holidays, I pretty much threw in the towel of any chance of starting a diet. \n\n\nNow January of 2025, I have started a diet again that is a modified version of keto but my motivation is gone. It's out of desperation, self hatred, and bitterness plus an extreme loathing for my natural genetics. \n\n\nMy body is beaten, sore, and tired. It knows what I'm doing and won't have it. My thyroid numbers have almost totally crashed in my bloodwork and my body temperature is all the way down to 97 degrees. Within 3 days of dieting, i shake with a feverish cold, no energy even on half a gram of caffeine,  and i am so lethargic, I can't focus at work. My workouts suffer and I almost immediately lose muscle despite my high protein intake, compounding my hideous look and body dysmorphia. My cravings are so bad, I can't stop myself. My work offers free pizza and cookies, I go completely nuts on it. They have all these sugary bullshit snacks offered in the breakroom i can't look at or else i murder them. EXACTLY what happened today. \n\n\nThe only thing preventing me from eating the entire inventory of Costco is my fear of jail time for stealing. I cannot stop the cravings. I can't even listen to fast food advertisements because my mouth starts watering. \n\n\nI hate what I see in the mirror so much that I am developing some self harm habits including slapping myself in the face, legs, but mostly hitting and punching my stomach, praying that it goes away. I would be totally happy at the weight i am if I didn't hold it all in my ugly, fat stomach that sticks out of every shirt and outfit. \n\n\nI'm on the verge of starving myself again and this time, my goal is to abuse thyroid medication to make it happen whether i see abs or God first. Plus, i want to use testosterone. My total testosterone has been sub 400 total for probably my whole life and ever since I started ordering it on my annual labs since 19. Nothing I have done has improved it. I have testosterone prescribed by a doctor I have been holding off on. Despite what people tell me that TRT won't help weight loss, everyone i know with high testosterone levels stays very lean and they eat like absolute pigs, worse than me. \n\n\nFor the 4 years I have been lifting in some methodology, i don't deserve to look like the disgusting slob I am. I want the physique I rightfully deserve for all the fucking work I have put into chasing it. \n\n\nWhatever drug it takes, I'm now no longer scared to do it. \n\n\nI'm done with everyone's conventional bullshit advice. It's time I take it into my own hands by controlling my very own body chemistry.  ", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

But computers can't read our minds, and even if they could, our minds are a jumbled mess. We're lazy and inconsistent wetware. We have no reliable system, and we're all over the place. But, unfortunately, it's these arbitrary emotional reactions that are fueling social media because algorithms try to make sense of us, and they can't. So, they fill in the gaps with best-guess horseshit and ads\u2014and then tailor *that* to suit *their* needs. A/B testing what we respond to because we've given no clue of anything else.\n\nOut in the real world\u2014away from the computers\u2014we have devised systems that work. All I'm saying is that we should start thinking about IRL when we're on the computer, because we're spending more and more time here and, well, it's becoming IRL that's not working as well as it could. \n\nExample: When I'm in my car, waiting to enter the roadway, someone might let me in (Upvote), so I'll wave (Upvote). The people behind don't usually honk (Downvote) because we've all been there, hoping someone will let us in. If no one ever lets anyone in and everyone honks instead, the traffic backs up, and the city will put in a stoplight. Then everyone has to wait. But they don't because we figure shit out like grownups. \n\nIt's the same when waiting in queue at the grocery, giving up a seat on the bus, or holding the door at the elevator. When someone smiles at you, you smile back. It's just stuff we do. Anonymously. Upvote, Upvote, Upvote. All day long. \n\nIf the meal at a restaurant is terrible, maybe we'll give it a one-star review (Downvote), but we better damn well make sure we still tip the waitress (Upvote). It wasn't her fault. Or, maybe it was, so do the obverse. \n\nIn a future world, grade school kids will learn about algorithms and how to steer them, but in the meantime, their precursors (us) need to start working on rules. Otherwise, we'll get miles of crap running down our feeds. If we don't fight back, the Downvoters win. Downvoters hate hate hate Upvotes. It makes their work harder. \n\nFor the most part, my new system is this:\n\nEssentially, I figure my Upvotes are free to me, but they're worth something to others. There's no reason to be stingy, they don't cost me a dime. Anyway, those totally free Upvotes are easily worth the price of admission to all the time I spend on Reddit or wherever else\u2014all the chuckles or the damn-I-never-thought-that stuff. Upvote, Upvote, Upvote. Why not? At least I might counter a Downvoter or two. Every little bit helps. \n\nSo, if a post stops me from scrolling, that's my first clue that it's Upvote-worthy. But then, maybe it's not as clever as I first thought, or it's a repost, wrong, or kinda dumb on second thought. Oh well, nevermind, keep scrolling. \n\nBut if it makes me laugh, Upvote. Easy decision. Or if I click to read some comments, Upvote it for getting me to do that. If I read comments and get sucked in, Upvote all the ones I read, even if I don't agree. And if it's a long chain, go back up and thank the instigating comments, Upvotes all around. It's free and easy. Those Redditors deserve some love for being there first and saying the right things. Encourage that. It's algorithm fodder. \n\nThen, if I comment, and especially if someone replies back, or *I get an Upvote*, I make doubly sure the OP gets one, too, damnit. That should be automatic. And especially so if I download the content or share the post (there should be ten upvotes for that). \n\nBut the Downvote should be rare, if ever. I definitely don't use it in haste, anger, or to be punitive. I will, though, use it when someone is being abusive or mean. TBH, in my 13 years on Reddit, I have yet to Downvote a post, only comments here and there. \n\nHere's the thing: This sort of behavior gives the algorithms something to munch on. What drives me crazy is seeing good posts with thousands of Upvotes in the comments but only a few dozen for the OP up top. Totally not fair.\n\nI get that the Upvotes drive that post higher up (I've actually coded that stuff), but the OP shouldn't have to beg for spare change while the commenters are all having a party at OP's expense. \n\nI know that people don't like to be told what to do, and I appreciate how Up/Downvoting is deeply personal and fulfilling\u2014our last most precious thing\u2014but IRL we *will* flush twice and zipper-merge onto the freeway. I'm just saying we should do that here, too.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

People should just communicate with their partners, jeez!\". These comments annoy me. \n\nI like to get my partner gifts for birthdays and valentines and Christmas, but I don't like asking her what she wants. I poke around, I check her amazon browsing history, I listen to things she talks about day to day and complaints she has around the house. I try to find something she'll love, but I want it to be a mystery. I love the excitement on her face when she wakes up or comes home to see a present sitting on her desk waiting for her. I love seeing how excited she gets unwrapping it eagerly. \n\nI think unexpected presents are way more exciting and fun than just being asked what you want and taken to buy it. I like to drop hints about stuff I would like throughout the year for my friends and family and I always feel a little disappointed to just be asked \"What would you like for your birthday/Christmas?\". I don't really want stuff, as I'm a minimalist and I don't like having too much stuff sitting around gathering dust. Despite this I cherish presents from friends and family because of the thought behind them. I would rather receive a random fun gift that someone I care about picked out by themselves than just have someone take me to the mall to buy whatever I want.\n\nThis same communication mentality comes up on engagement ring questions all the time. My partner and I have discussed our future extensively. We both know we want to get married as soon as our studies are behind us and our careers are stable. I don't want to ask for her ring size or take her to a jeweler to pick out a ring for herself. I want to sneak around and measure her rings. I want to order a ring sizer and secretly measure her fingers while she sleeps. I want to compile a list of the styles of rings she likes and doesn't like that we see on social media and while out at the mall passing through jewelry stores. I want to buy the ring in secret and surprise her. I want to see her face light up as she realizes what's happening.\n\nI think communication is a fundamental requirement for relationships, but I don't think every couple needs to openly discuss every little thing. I think surprises can be healthy and fun in a relationship, and I'm sick of seeing the \"Just talk to your partner\" comments on posts from people trying to give their partners some unexpected joy.\n\nEnd of Rant", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

There are so many features and updates that people never asked for, that make the platform worse and that nevertheless tech companies try to push on you.\n\nI remember when \"fleets\" were a thing on Twitter. Nobody asked for it, nobody wanted it, they actually ended up getting rid of them because even they realized it was ridiculous.\n\nThen there's the recent Reddit UI change. Maybe I'm in the minority here, idk, but I absolutely HATE the new UI design. It is absolutely terrible and I find it much more annoying and harder to work with. Not to mention that the \"hide\" button apparently does nothing anymore in this new UI? And everything feels like it's floating in an endless white void. Overall it feels much less organized (to me, anyway). The previous UI was working fine, why change it?\n\nOr maybe the most recent thing which is the Windows Recall mode or whatever. Which has your computer take a screenshot of what you're doing every few seconds and then uses AI to search for it. Who the hell asked for this feature? Well, I say feature. Who the hell asked for this privacy hazard? And they may just force it on all of us eventually anyway, we'll have to see.\n\nWith features that are optional and can be turned off or left unused, it's at least more acceptable because you can not use it. But a decent percentage of the time they're features that literally can't be turned off or reverted to a previous state and that you have to use if you're going to use the app, program, operating system, etc. in question.\n\nI'm just so freaking tired of our \"tech overlords\" constantly rolling out useless features and pointless updates that chance stuff seemingly for the sake of changing it.\n\nI don't want tweets that disappear after 24 hours. I don't want a privacy hazard. And I want the freaking previous Reddit UI back.\n\nI have no problem with changes to apps. Sometimes new features are awesome or UI updates are an improvement.

Alot of my friendships if you can even call them that are quite weak already so i would assume i wouldn't get much farther than that. But recently in my english class honestly the cutest person sat on the other side if the classroom she need very kind and had a soft voice and noy only that seemed very smart or atleast smarter than the rest of the people in my class and i was attracted that. She seemed to be into books alot personally im not much of a reader but even before knowing her i knew i needed to increase my literacy but after learning that it became an incentive for me to read. during our book talk assignment in class most people seemed very mediocre with their books tbh but hers had effort it really seemed like she genuinely liked her book. After that i went to our library to find a copy of the book she had but turns out she bought it herself because it was not at our library. So i had an idea i liked her but although i had many friends in general i have a hard time making friends my idea was to ask her for the book for me to read during winter break. And thankfully a friend i had knew her so through my friend i was able to go up to her and ask her about it. Unfortunately, she didn't have itnon her but she offered to lend me it after break. I was happy about it but kinda regretted my introduction. Nonetheless over break i didn't think about her like crazy but she was definitely within my top 10 thoughts and i kinda fantasized out future together which was unhinged of me considering i barley knew her. Today i decided to download bacl instagram since tiktok is getting banned and i decided to look her and turne out we actually know alot of the same people but unfortunately shes dating someone already. And at this point as im making this post ive guven up my pursuit but would still love to be friends with her and read that book she has. And her boyfriend must be a lucky guy. Im hurt in a way because usually im attracted to men but religiously i questioned myself if its ok or no. ive had many fights with my mom about my sexuality back and fourth but i really thought i could only be attracted to other men but this one girl really made me rethink it and at one point i thought could this be god trying to tell me something? Is this the person for me? But that was all quite delusional now that i look back at it.

My understanding is that the insurance market as a whole has calculated they can expose themselves (at a reinsurance level) to around 3 billion dollars any one loss, any one location, globally, (although there may be several losses per year) so for these fires (somewhere around 30 billion now) to have all been insured would have been company busting.

When insurers are getting out, look around - maybe you should too.  \nIn Australia post the fires here, folks that decided to rebuild have a whole slew of new building regulations - or they can\u2019t get insurance.

For some reason a couple of people thought my last post belong in choosing beggars. All I was asking for was resources goddammit. I did have one lovely person who sent enough money for a weeks worth of Pediasure for my toddler and another who offered to send me diapers even though I did not ask and I CANNOT thank you both enough if you see this. And thank you to the people who actually UNDERSTOOD my post and gave me actual helpful resources as I was just going in loops for awhile. I wasn't asking for money, just resources.\n\nI couldn't sleep last night and don't typically get on TikTok unless it's to find a live ASMR video to help me sleep from someone I like but I can't find the live button on there anymore. (I know TikTok is a cesspool of angry trolls and wannabe thirst traps too, but I've seen the good in it as well.) So I doom scrolled for a bit and I found a farmer on there who's 5 year old son is going blind due to a condition he has. He had been posting for awhile and I guess has enough following that he is making some money off the app and ALL that man was asking for was for people to stay the full minute and watch his video to help him raise the money to pay for his son's surgery. He didn't ask for money or handouts, just to watch the video. I watched it over and over and watched more to catch up on his life, and someone was kind enough to start him a GoFundMe which exceeded what he needed in like a couple of days. I was so incredibly happy for him because you could see how grateful he was. He even offered to send back the extra money they made on it. I don't remember seeing ONE hateful comment to that man who hit a rough spot due to a rough condition (although there were too many comments to sift through so there may have been a few at the bottom....there probably was because jealous and/or miserable people can't help but be assholes even to people going through hardships.) But sometimes I feel like people are just so misogynistic. I felt his pain and hardship but at least my child is mostly healthy and not going blind. I try not to think that way, but I used to be a physical therapist assistant and became so miserable in that field from being overworked and underpaid and worked under SO MUCH misogyny that I had to get out of it. I'd rather wait tables than go back to that field if I could find child care.\n\nMaybe it's karma coming for me to hit a rough spot like I have, or just life being life. I don't know. I was a serious junkie for a good decade of my life and will have 6 years clean at the end of this month and it's something I am so exceptionally proud of because it was one of the hardest things I have ever done. (Yes, I took a few Xanax's to get me through a crazy panic attack after Thanksgiving that landed me in the ER after puking exorcist style for a good 5 or 6 days straight and couldn't hold water down, and even the shots of Zofran and Phenergan could not stop the puking. I took ONLY what was needed to get food in me and am done. Never once got high and have zero intentions of doing so again.) I do not let that take away my clean time. \n\nDue to that crazy illness, my toddler having stomach and bowel issues, then my boyfriend getting pneumonia right after I got better and ending up in the hospital for a good week, we both lost our jobs. I had made an OnlyFans to try and get SOME type of income. That shit is more work than I thought it would be. I have read the whole \"Rome wasn't built in a day\" so I know growing a following like crazy in even a week would not be realistic. I put a lot of work into it at first and tried my best to promote. But as things have gotten harder,  needing to job hunt, and a sickish needy toddler, I haven't been as consistent as one should be. I have like 10 followers on there and have gotten 2 tips the whole time I've been on the site and OF takes 20% of anything you make....so it's not like I'm making a killing off of it or even enough to be close to live on. Not to mention you can't even cash out unless you have $20 in it and then have to wait a week for that and another 3-5 business days for it to go into your account. So when you need food and your toddler can't hold her poo in and the diapers are disappearing like crazy, that money sitting there doesn't matter. I think I have one cash out left and the way things are going, it will probably be my last one and enough to get another thing of Pediasure for my kid.\n\nI literally didn't think I would live to see the age of 30 and somehow made it to almost 40. And if people wanna actually see me naked at this age then fuckin awesome. Aging has been weirdly hard on me as I didn't expect to ever \"grow old\" or even middle age, so I won't lie that I get a small confidence boost when I get compliments as I've tried my best to take care of myself after putting my body through hell and birthing 2 children. One troll actually made a snarky comment that my hair looked like it was nice and had been done and to get my priorities straight. I haven't had my hair cut or done in over 2 years\ud83d\ude02 I hate my real hair so much (I seriously believe COVID ruined it, too) that I had bought 2 fake cheap ass wigs off Temu when I wasn't struggling. Then the rest I have I won on their stupid farm and fish game. Same with Shein. Got like 5 things and only had to pay for the cheapest thing which was $5 and this was over the summer before our car started breaking down. Since then, I have won some dress up clothes for my daughter and her Halloween costume. I guess I should be flattered someone thought my cheap ass Temu or Shein wig looks expensive? Haha. Fuckin crazy. I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs and my child IS my priority. I could easily go vegan and eat the shitty food from food banks and I am grateful for it even if it doesn't sound like it. The problem is my child won't eat ANY of it. I have to sneak strawberry Pediasure and a Multivitamin droplet in her milk (that she all of a sudden will only drink warmed up when she used to only drink it cold) just to get nutrients in her. She gags watching me eat things she has never even tried. I've tried everything in the book to get her to try new foods and it's just not working. So until we hopefully get Medicaid, I do have a referral for speech therapist or OT to hopefully help with that as her diet is what's most likely causing the bowel issues.\n\nI know this thing is all over the place and doubt anyone will read it and will probably get downvoted to hell if they do. I'm to a point I don't care anymore. Just needed to rant or vent or whatever you want to call this. I may be struggling but it doesn't mean I'm sitting on my ass hoping for handouts. I have to work from home due to no help with my child. My boyfriend has put in I don't know how many resumes to places and so far has only gotten one call to setup an interview and we are still waiting on that call. All I know is that even though things are hard, I try my best to not let my child see or feel it. I am overall a happy person and refuse to let the internet bring me down or life in general. It's just wild that even though I may seem like I have no morals or dignity because I'm putting my naked ass on the internet while in survival mode, I still feel I have more integrity than the miserable ass trolls who have nothing better to do than to find posts to shit on, especially to people struggling. I'm not gonna be one of those that just say \"fuck you\" and go away, but I really do hope that you do not hit a rough spot like this and find yourself selling your body online or swallowing your pride to ask for help and resources. I always felt I have paid things forward. I have volunteered my time, helped a lot of people in my old field because I actually liked doing it and not for the money because lord knows I did not get paid well. I just got sick of getting shit on. I have helped people when they needed it when I was in a good place. And I am lucky that I have had a couple of people who have now done the same for me and given me actual good resources that may be able to help me.\n\nSo to the good humans out there who have real hearts and care, thank you. Just thank you for being YOU and even reading this and listening as sometimes getting things off my chest can help more than anything. To the trolls, I hope you find happiness and that you stop letting your misery eat you alive and taking it out on people who have done absolutely nothing to you. Good luck out there. I don't wish evil or bad things upon you. Just go find your happiness instead of wasting your misery and time trolling online. \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc7d\n\n  \n", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Google Photos, in particular, is the main problem. I tried to back up my photos, but when I did, it filled up my storage space, and now I keep getting constant reminders that I\u2019m out of space. What makes it worse is that when I try to free up space or download my photos, things don\u2019t work like they should, and I feel like I have no control over my own files.\n\nHere\u2019s where things went wrong: When I backed up my photos, Google moved them into Google Photos\u2019 cloud storage. But it didn\u2019t make a direct copy of them on my device, and it didn\u2019t give me easy access to them in a way I could manage or store elsewhere. Instead of leaving my files in a simple, accessible folder structure, Google Photos just takes over and stores my media in its own ecosystem. And when I try to free up space, it feels like I\u2019m pushing a boulder uphill. I delete photos or try to clear things out, but Google keeps telling me my storage is full, and nothing seems to change after deleting files.\n\nThe real problem is trying to get my files back. I tried using Google Takeout, thinking it would help me download my files in a more accessible format, but it hasn\u2019t really done what I needed. My photos are still stuck in the Google Photos app, and it\u2019s not easy to access them without either re-uploading them to the cloud or dealing with a complicated, unreliable download process.\n\nOn top of all this, the system keeps pushing me to buy more storage space, even though I just want to manage things on my own terms. Every time I open Gmail, Google Photos, or Google Drive, I\u2019m bombarded with messages about running out of space. The constant pressure to upgrade or \"free up space\" while seeing no real results has understandably left me frustrated and feeling trapped in Google\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t care much about my photos anymore. They\u2019re just memories at this point, and I hardly ever use them, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want them erased without any control. I just want to either store them somewhere more accessible or let go of them entirely, but I don\u2019t want Google holding my files hostage.\n\nAt this point, it feels like I need to find a way out of this mess\u2014whether by moving my files to external storage, switching to a more user-friendly cloud service, or even considering a complete switch to something like Linux, where I have more control over my data.\n\nIt\u2019s not really about the photos anymore; it\u2019s about the frustration of being stuck in a system that doesn\u2019t give me the flexibility to manage my own files.

It\u2019s just that I finally feel it\u2019s come to the forefront and I really want to address it/rant about it.\n\nThis is a rant. It does not require a response or responses. More especially it doesn\u2019t require suggestions on modifications of thinking or approach, etc. etc. I point this out because it is a natural human tendency. \n\nBut part of my rant is the fact that when I find myself in a place where I want to learn more, I will go and do that. It gives me great confidence and a feeling of control to go and find my own information and to collate it and evaluate it for myself. Just letting you know upfront.\n\nInclude in your pre-knowledge the fact that I do have ADHD, but I also have a high amount of my own curiosity which has been with me my entire life. From the time I was eight years old, I was borrowing stacks of books from the library that I could not even carry. I would have to stack them up and hold them with my chin in order to be able to get them in the house. This would be pre-computer.\n\nI am a voracious reader and learner about things that catch my interest. Not only what catches my interest, but what catches my concern. I do my very best to learn as much as possible about whatever is concerning me, about what a possible solution could be from the ache in my back to the leak that I\u2019m having in my laundry room. \n\nAnd I collect all this information, and then see what part of it applies to me, what part of it I personally can apply or if it is outside my scope. And if there is something specific that I need further information about. It\u2019s at this point that I reach out to expand my knowledge, looking for more expertise or looking for people who can point me in the right direction.\n\nAnyway, because I do these kinds of focused learnings, I sometimes find myself in random subreddits where I expand on things until everyone exhausted.\n\nBut at the same time, I also understand that some of the knowledge and information I collected over the years, can become stale. \n\nBecause more information, knowledge, and technology continues to come out so, if I think I\u2019m sharing about something that might be dated, I go back out and I update my knowledge as well. Or if I am making a recommendation based off of something I learned earlier, I do try to mention if I feel it is stale and recommend that the other person do their own research just to verify and to have access to the best available knowledge.\n\nThis is what it means to me to be a lifelong learner.\n\n\u2014- OK. Here is the rant \u2014-\n\nBut I find in so many different platforms, group chats and many many Reddit posts, no one does this. \n\nPeople just show up, they post things like \u201cdoes anybody else?\u201d (The answer is always yes, *eyeroll*). And then they proceeded to explain whatever is on their mind, as if it is the first time anyone has ever had that thought, has ever had that problem, has ever run into that issue. And the more they express themselves the more obvious it is that they have not bothered in the slightest to try to help themselves or inform themselves. Not because they shouldn\u2019t reach out and get support. But that they didn\u2019t even try to support themselves to begin with. \n\nThe idea that they themselves have the power and capacity and the agency to learn something for themselves, seems to have been ripped out or never even taught to so many of the posters we have these days.\n\nThey all share about their personal issues, which, granted are theirs, and they have the right to their own experience. \n\nBut what they fail at miserably is gathering knowledge about their status and where they are so that then they can make an informed question about a thing that still remains as a gap in their knowledge versus the entire dumpster fire of no knowledge that they show up with.\n\nAnd this drives me up a fucking wall. \n\nWE! This generation, this collection of generations, this current society, we all have the world at our fingertips. The world of knowledge, the world of experience, the world of information. \n\nAnd if we are knowledgeable enough, and we care enough, we can go and learn so much. We can learn enough to know what we don\u2019t know, so that we can become informed consumers, informed seekers of truth. \n\nVersus what I see are veritable vegetables who just post and say - waaa. Let me trauma dump or trouble dump on you, with no critical thinking on my part. And you guys tell me things, and if I like it, I will smile and agree, and if I don\u2019t like it, I will throw a baby hissy fit. And the reason I will do this is because the things you say do not fit my world view. And my world view is so tiny because I haven\u2019t bothered to even try to understand my own situation. Either within my own circle of influence or within the wider balance of world experience.\n\nEveryone has it available in them so that they don\u2019t come to the table as complete idiots. \n\nBut with what will hopefully be clarifying or specificity questions. Not just open blanket shit that has already been answered 1000 times in 1 million different ways. Which, as an aside, they could\u2019ve made a simple Reddit search about whatever the concern is, and they would have found the other multiple threads where people have already offered their commentary, their advice and often brilliant ways of thinking about a problem differently.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting to see the same things posted over and over again. And then for these people to say \u201canswer me.\u201d \n\nAnd when, out of generosity and out of acknowledgment that we have all been there, we offer the answers that we have, so many of them are like, that\u2019s not what I wanted to hear. What do you mean I actually have to do or think differently. \n\nThen you have to ask yourself why they even posted. \n\nWhy should we expend our energy and effort to inform so many of you posters of things you could\u2019ve learned in three seconds if you had even bothered to try for yourself versus immediately whining, and knocking on somebody else\u2019s door? \n\nSo if you have seen me sometimes, just drop simple, direct sentences like \u201cgo look it up, take all of your symptoms, take all of your concerns, take the keywords, go and do the research\u201d - and I don\u2019t start it all with something flowery or how much I hear them or understand them. And I don\u2019t end it with something flowery other than \u201cGood Luck.\u201d\n\nThis is not me being mean, or cruel, or rude. It may look that way, it may feel that way. It\u2019s me being factual, direct, and hopefully letting them know that they have all the same resources that we do who are answering them - where do they think we get this information?\n\nWe get it through our own experiences, through our own research and learning, and our own evaluation and application.\n\nThere is no secret sauce. There is no sage on a mountain. \n\nLet me empower each, and every one of you who is facing a normal human situation to go forth and do your research and evaluate and determine how it relates to you and then if there is something more specific, and ask the community.\n\nBoom. You have the same abilities as we do. You may not have the same years. But you have the same abilities - at least when it comes to gathering knowledge.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you care enough about yourself to even try? Why don\u2019t you have enough pride/self-sustainability in yourself to even attempt to solve the problem on your own first, even if you get it wrong?\n\nHaven\u2019t you learned, that you are the only one who knows what you need?

Coral reefs in the region face increasing stress from pollution, warming waters, and diseases, and the activities of cruise ships exacerbate these problems. Here\u2019s how cruise ships contribute to coral diseases and ecosystem decline:\n\nHow Cruise Ships Contribute to Coral Pathogenic Diseases\n\t1.\tWastewater Discharges (Sewage and Greywater):\n\t\u2022\tCruise ships discharge untreated or inadequately treated wastewater containing harmful bacteria, viruses, and nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus).\n\t\u2022\tThese pollutants promote algal blooms and bacterial growth, which can lead to coral diseases like black band disease and white syndrome.\n\t2.\tBallast Water Dumping:\n\t\u2022\tShips take in ballast water at one location and release it in another, introducing invasive microorganisms and pathogens into coral reef ecosystems.\n\t\u2022\tPathogens like Serratia marcescens, a bacterium found in human sewage, have been linked to coral diseases such as white pox in the Caribbean.\n\t3.\tSediment Resuspension:\n\t\u2022\tAnchoring and dredging by cruise ships near reefs stir up sediments, which can settle on corals, smothering them and making them more vulnerable to infections.\n\t\u2022\tSediment-laden water also reduces light penetration, inhibiting coral photosynthesis and weakening their defenses against pathogens.\n\t4.\tChemical Pollution:\n\t\u2022\tChemicals in greywater, cleaning agents, and oils from cruise ships introduce toxins that stress coral reefs, making them more susceptible to disease.\n\t\u2022\tSunscreens washed off passengers in marine environments contribute to coral bleaching and increase vulnerability to infections.\n\t5.\tClimate Change Contributions:\n\t\u2022\tCruise ships emit significant greenhouse gases, driving ocean warming and acidification. Warmer waters and increased acidity weaken coral resilience and exacerbate disease outbreaks.\n\nDiseases Affecting Caribbean Coral\n\t\u2022\tStony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD):\n\t\u2022\tSCTLD has been devastating Caribbean coral reefs since 2014. It spreads rapidly and can kill coral within weeks.\n\t\u2022\tSewage and polluted runoff, possibly linked to cruise ship activity, are suspected vectors for the bacteria causing SCTLD.\n\t\u2022\tWhite Pox Disease:\n\t\u2022\tLinked to Serratia marcescens, often traced to untreated sewage from coastal areas and ships.\n\t\u2022\tBlack Band Disease:\n\t\u2022\tExacerbated by nutrient pollution, this disease kills coral tissue through microbial mats.\n\nSolutions to Mitigate Cruise Ship Impacts on Coral Reefs\n\t1.\tStricter Wastewater Regulations:\n\t\u2022\tBan untreated sewage and ballast water discharge in reef areas.\n\t\u2022\tMandate advanced onboard wastewater treatment systems for cruise ships.\n\t2.\tNo-Anchor Zones:\n\t\u2022\tEstablish and enforce no-anchor zones near coral reefs to prevent sediment resuspension and physical damage.\n\t3.\tMarine Pathogen Monitoring:\n\t\u2022\tImplement monitoring programs to identify and control pathogen sources near coral reefs.\n\t4.\tPort Management:\n\t\u2022\tUse designated docking areas and invest in infrastructure like onshore wastewater reception facilities.\n\t5.\tSustainable Tourism Practices:\n\t\u2022\tPromote eco-friendly cruise options and educate tourists on protecting coral reefs.\n\nCruise ships play a significant role in the decline of Caribbean coral reefs by introducing pathogens, pollution, and physical stress.

I'm 23, of Italian and Brazilian origin, and I've spent most of my life in France, whereas he arrived here this year, at the age of 26, to pursue a master's degree. He told me that he first noticed me dancing in a nightclub one night and liked me straight away. Coincidentially, I moved in an appartment shared by six students, and he happened to be one of my roomates. He liked me even more when he saw my cooking skills and my devotion to my academic success. I would also help him learn french (beware, I was a french teacher for a while a year ago), help him find birthday gifts for his friends, talk on his behalf on the phone when he needed to get important things done, stayed up until very late to help him book flight tickets for his trips. We can say that things moved pretty quickly and we were rapidly an official couple.\n\nIn just a few weeks of our relationship, not only did he compare me on numerous occasions to Afghan women, saying that they are more docile and handle conflicts more calmly. I want to note that he often accused me of wanting to end the relationship too easily, criticising my lack of commitment, saying that I act like this because of the culture I grew up in. Meanwhile, he criticises Afghan women for wanting to stay at home, do the housework and be financially dependent on their partners.\n\nHaving grown up in Afghanistan, he received no education whatsoever on sexuality, contraception, women's mentrual cycle, etc. So I had to explain everything to him and carry most of the responsibilities, like buying condoms because he was too ashamed do it himself, taking plan B pills, or having appointments with a gynecologist. Keep in mind that throughout our relationship, especially since we started having sex, I\u2019m afraid of getting pregnant because he is very little informed about contraception and he does not know how to use a condom. This has led to many arguments because I felt an imbalance in the taking of responsibility of each as well as pregnancy scares.\n\nGoing into this relationship, I knew I had unresolved deep seated traumas that affect my everyday life and relationships, so I took matters into my own hands and went to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist to be better.\n\nBeware that I was, and am still, very physically sick. One day, he told me a story of a link he had with a married girl back when he was in Afghanistan. They would meet secretly and she openly shared her feelings for him (although he said he did not love her). The last time they met, he offered to hold her hand for the last time because she was going to move to the US. Since then, they had kept contact over messages. I expressed my discomfort regarding this situation and I asked him to cut off all contact with her, which he did, but very reluctantly. This led to tension between us and we didn't really speak for a week.\n\nWhat's more, I had told him, even before we got in a relationship, that I don't want to have children (one of the reasons being that I carry a genetically transmissible disease that exposes me to high-risk pregnancies, miscarriages and a high probability that my children will be born with the disease themselves). However, I'm open to the idea of adopting in the future if my partner is down. He didn't say anything at the time. Perhaps he thought I was going to change my mind, because later in the relationship he expressed his desire to start a family with his own genealogical succession in a few years from now.\n\nFor Christmas, I invited him to my home, or rather my parents', as they were spending the holidays in the South of France. It gave us a chance to spend some time alone, plus I could look after my cats. We had a great time, but I spent almost all my savings so that we could eat, whereas he didn't pay for anything. I was a bit disappointed with my Christmas present... I feel really ungrateful saying this, but I spent a fair amount of money on a meaningful present for him, a vintage Polaroid camera. He gave me a sweater of a cheap brand, not very good quality and in a color I never wear (beige, even though I've always only worn black and often yapped about how convenient it is to only own black clothes). He also took advantage of an unforeseen situation for which I had to leave on the morning of December 24 to buy me a bouquet of roses and write me a letter expressing his gratitude. I was touched by his gesture, but with hindsight, I think it was a bit rushed, last minute presents.\n\nWhen my parents came back, my mother was very upset when she realized that I'd spent all my savings and he hadn't paid a thing. In my conception, guests aren't obliged to spend, but it's true that, like everyone else, we're facing financial difficulties, and a financial contribution from him wouldn't have gone amiss. My mother then told me privately that he's no good to me and that I'd better leave him. I went to see him while he was playing Tekken in my living room and told him, saddly, what my mother had said. We then decided to leave early the next day to avoid any tension. It was noted that in their interactions, my mother was indeed quite suspicious of him and that this may be due to a certain racism towards the Afghans.\n\nHe left shortly after we got home because he was visiting his brother in Sweden, so I made him some sandwiches for the road. He then left for Estonia on a school trip and we have been communicating remotely for three weeks. Before yesterday I told him about my day, and I mentioned the fact that the more years pass and the more I become like my mother. He then said \"keep being yourself and don\u2019t become racist\". I found his remark extremely inappropriate, although he may indeed feel uneasy when I mention my mother, I do not think it is appropriate to speak like that. I was not really sure what to say and he tried to make me believe that he did not say that my mother is racist but I am not stupid, he did not say it but he strongly suggested it. He finished the call to call me back a few minutes later and apologize but I was not in the mood to forgive and also being away, I did not want to create a useless quarrel so I said it was not serious.\n\nThe next day I didn\u2019t hear from him, no message. I knew he had a busy day so I didn\u2019t want to disturb him. I sent him a message at night to tell him that I hope he had a good day and a good weekend. We got a call the next day where he didn\u2019t want to show his face and was trying to convince me that he didn\u2019t say anything bad about my mother. Then we came across an argument that I often used to say in our conflicts, that we are not compatible. We then mutually decided to put an end to this relationship. He states that from now on we are just friends, but I don't even want to stay friends him and I also want my camera back ahah. But we still have to live 2 months under the same roof, which I'm not too thrilled but I'm not worried either.\n\nI know that his mother and sisters are living in terrible conditions where they are and that this is his top concern, taking precedence over the relationship. He also said that this relationship was slowing down his studies and his plans to bring his family here to France.\n\nBut what I want to highlight here is this man's completely unrealistic expectations. I'm really glad to have got rid of this relationship that was weighing me down so much, there are so many things I'm not talking about because otherwise my post would be far too long (and it is already very long, thank you to those who are still here). I wish him well and I wish he gets reunited with his family one day.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I used to flinch when anyone would walk past me, and they\u2019d laugh when I did.  \nI\u2019m the second oldest of the kids still living in the house, and I\u2019m the biggest physically (6ft, 195 pounds). I don\u2019t do it as much now, but I used to shit myself whenever one of my sisters would walk past me, especially my younger sister, who was the main person who beat me. I barely leave my room after work, and my family makes fun of me for it. But then, when I leave my room, I just get bullied. They make fun of me by calling me gay, pedo, lonely, and they mock me for not having a girlfriend or having sex in over two years. They always make fun of whoever I\u2019m seeing, make fun of my friends, and it\u2019s constant. I genuinely can\u2019t get a word out at dinner without being interrupted and having the piss taken out of me.  \nMy sisters are my mum\u2019s little posse\u2014they agree with everything she says, and in return, they never have to put in any effort with helping her or around the house. Every now and then, one of them will vacuum the living room or mop the kitchen after being asked to do it for over a week. I always help out. Just today, I helped my mum with the shopping, brought it all from the car to the house, put it away myself, and then moved all of the rubbish from Christmas and my sister\u2019s birthday to the car so she could take it to the tip. I just did that without thinking twice, and I didn\u2019t stop for a break halfway through, which is what everyone in my family does after being begged to help.  \nAs previously mentioned, I work. I\u2019m the only one in the family, other than my mum, with a full-time job. I pay my rent every month on time, every time. I spend extra money on food and supplies when my mum runs short, and I\u2019m always buying everyone snacks because it\u2019s just a nice thing to do. There are two other people in the house who aren\u2019t in high school and are eligible for work\u2014the two oldest girls who abused me. They go to college and have part-time jobs. My mum believes it\u2019s fine for them not to pay rent because they only work part-time, and their hours are inconsistent, so they bring in different wages every week. I had the idea of them paying a percentage\u2014just giving my mum 10%-20% of what they make each week. I thought it was fair, considering they don\u2019t really contribute much to the house, but apparently, I\u2019m just envious and it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d that I pay rent and they don\u2019t.  \nHere is where I get frustrated the most. My little brother and I \"share\" the attic room. The Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t connect up there, so I had to buy my own Ethernet cable, which nobody liked. Also, the heating is busted\u2014the radiators barely go past 7\u00b0C and can't even dry off a towel. There\u2019s a wall between us, but it\u2019s thin, and the door is broken too\u2014it doesn\u2019t shut. We can practically hear, see, and smell each other's rooms from our own beds.  \nMy little brother has severe ADHD. You\u2019d think he\u2019s a clean freak, but it\u2019s the opposite. His side of the room is a mountain of clothes on the floor, literal mud, sweat stains, old food, and tissues with fluids on them. His walls are covered in torn wallpaper and mold. He even punched a hole through the wall and filled it in with a crisp packet (these are UK walls, so they\u2019re not weak). My room is the only one in the house that\u2019s in a constant state of cleanliness.  \nMy sisters, on the other hand, have the biggest rooms in the house. While I was between jobs for four months, I covered my rent by scraping the wallpaper off my younger sister\u2019s room and helping with pasting the new one on, knocking down her old furniture, and carrying the newer, heavier ones upstairs for her. She used to share with my other younger sister, but she practically moved into a cupboard because it wasn\u2019t fair that she had to share her room with her boyfriend and 11-year-old sister. My older sister has the actual biggest room in the house. Her room is as bad as my brother\u2019s. Food, clothes, and towels are everywhere. Her room is filled with toys too. She\u2019s nearly 20 years old, and her room looks like a museum to her childhood. Plastic horses and lions cover her mirrors, and teddy bears and other plush toys line the top of her room. I can\u2019t even explain how many there are without a photo.  \nAll both of my sisters do is go to college, come home, and sleep. If they aren\u2019t doing that, then they\u2019re either watching YouTube, Netflix, etc. Most nights, they aren\u2019t even home. My younger sister is always at her boyfriend\u2019s, so her room is barren. My older sister is out drinking at universities and staying at her friends' houses, so her room is empty most nights. My older sister will disappear for weeks on end. I always ask myself, what is the point of them having the biggest rooms? And why am I the one helping with renovations on them? I helped with my younger sister\u2019s room practically by myself every day for four months, and I\u2019ve already been told I\u2019m doing my older sister\u2019s room. They\u2019re never here. My younger sister\u2019s boyfriend said he\u2019s only ever seen my older sister 4-5 times, and they\u2019ve been dating for a long time. Again, neither of them pays rent. My younger sister is here only half the nights, so there\u2019s no point in having a room, and when she does come home, she\u2019s with her boyfriend, so now there\u2019s an extra two mouths to feed. Both of my sisters are entitled as all hell.  \nI have tried and tried and tried again to change the bedrooms, but it doesn\u2019t fit my mum\u2019s plan. I understand she\u2019s the head of the household, so I have to respect whatever she says and does, but everything seems \"pro-daughter.\" I\u2019ve had conversations, I\u2019ve had arguments, and I was so desperate for my own room that I even made a PowerPoint presentation on why it would be better, more fair, and even made floor plans of what it could look like. What I\u2019ve been told is this: the only chance I have at getting my own room is when my little sister leaves for the military at the end of the year, or if I move out myself. But because of all of this, I get picked on. I get picked on and bullied for wanting a fair and even household. We\u2019ve been living in this house for nearly three years now, and the only room change was my younger sister moving into the old cramped washroom.  \nI\u2019m not saying I deserve more than my sisters. I\u2019m not saying I hate my sisters or my mum. I just know, for a fact, that I\u2019m putting in a billion times more effort than every one of my siblings, on top of my full-time job, and I\u2019m getting less than they are for the little to nothing they\u2019re doing.

So I yelled at them too and said, \"Please get them to quiet down. They are your kids this is not my job!\" And left the room.\n\nWhy were all the parents just sitting there? They all know we've been having complains about them being loud. It's so rude of them, and I don't like to yell at people, but I have to do my job of keeping the hotel orderly. Why do I have to parent their kids? God, I hope hockey season will be over soon. \n\nAnyways, that's my rant.

{"post": {"title": "I'm done with flying", "id": "1hz254f", "created_utc": 1736619650.0, "selftext": "Here's my report on the last 6 (consecutive flights). EVERY SINGLE TIME SOMETHING MAJOR WENT WRONG. I just don't care anymore about the environment. Flying - the technology - is amazing; I studied aerospace engineering and work in the field; it is really cool stuff! But the administration that the airlines/airport systems have built, that is the problem. They treat you like cattle. Every step of the way: TSA, wait lines, boarding, sitting on the airplane, deboarding; it's all a cattle factory. In fact, I worked my past career in slaughterhouses and I can assure you; the cattle are treated much better than we are.\n\n**Flight 1: Destination: SAN; 2023**: Return flight had a connection in DEN. Weather was inclement, pilot didn't want to land. Redirected to PHX. Late in the night. 8 flights were directed to PHX. By the time everyone was rebooked, it was 4am (i.e., I had to stay awake until then sitting on the Southwest queue). I felt like my soul was removed from my body out of sleeplessness. Of course we didn't get a hotel. Got a connecting flight back, PHX-DFW, then DFW-destination. Lost an entire day (plus the week-long impact of sleeplessness on your body)\n\n**Flight 2: Destination: DCA; 2023**: Departing flight had a connection in DFW, as far as I remember. The plane landed at the opposite side of the huge airport with a 1h connecting time. I think the plane was delayed, so I had 30 minutes to connect. Of course I ran, but there is a train you need to take to the other terminal. I arrived by the time the flight was closing - only because I sprinted to the damn gate. I made it; so I was ok. But I'm healthy - if I was older, I wouldn't have made it.\n\n**Flight 3: Destination: LIS; 2024**: Returning flight had one of those unusual crap that nobody knows how to deal with: The flight LIS-DCA was on time; but the flight DCA-destination was somehow rebooked to depart 1 hour **earlier**. Since we needed to go through customs to get back to the US and go through TSA again, it was impossible to get to the gate on time. Since no flight was delayed, it was the case where **the connecting flight departed earlier**, nobody knew what to do with me: Jetblue said that it was TAP's fault, TAP said it was Jetblue's fault. Of course nobody wanted to pay the hotel for me to have a god damn night of sleep. It was 11PM by the time I had a non-outcome and I realized I needed to stay for the next day. I was not willing to pay the $500 hotel (yes, the hotels were that much booked last minute) in DC without knowing if any of the two airlines would pick up the bill. I stayed overnight at the airport again, sleepless (you can't sleep with that much light). Ruined my health for weeks. Nobody picked up the responsibility, of course.\n\n**Flight 4: Destination: MSP; 2024**: Had to book this one somewhat urgently, only 5 days in advance. The only options had 3 connections. Of course one of them was delayed. Once again, here I go running for my life to catch the connection. I made it (again, only because I can sprint). Maybe this one is the least \"major\" issue I had...\n\n**Flight 5: Destination: SLC; 2024:** Origin flight had a connection in ORD. For no apparent reason (i.e., traffic control or whatever) the first flight from the origin-ORD kept getting delayed. We sat on that airplane for 2 hours waiting for takeoff (mind you, without AC, sweating like pigs). The 1:30h connection time was completely eaten up. They automatically rebooked me to the next day and sent me to a flea-infested Days inn. I was giving a talk the next day; which of course I missed - i.e., the whole purpose of the travel. Had to quarantine my bag when I came back home. I had fleas all over my body. Thankfully I didn't bring bed bugs to my home.\n\n**Flight 6: Destination: MCO; 2025**: (this just happened yesterday). Well, first; the origin flight had a connection in JFK. Light snowy weather required the aircraft to be deiced. That took about an hour to do so. Here I go again; running for the gate. Made it. Oh.... the nightmare would be in the return flight:\n\nReturn flight, MCO-JFK: While we're boarding, we run out of overhead bin space. Can't put my carry-on bag anywhere. Flight attendant says it needs to be checked. At this point, I'm blocking the aisle for a good 5 minutes, there's a lot of social pressure, everyone is mad I'm hogging the lane. I eventually give the bag to the flight attendant. What does he do with it? He writes my seat number on a napkin and places it over the bag. Hands it to the gate check agent (I think, I couldn't see it). Do you think he gave me (or any of the passengers who faced this issue) a ticket with the bag number? Of course not! Of course the bag is nowhere to be found now and I don't have a bag number to track. I complain right away when the flight arrives in JFK, because I know what's gonna happen. The gate agent has no clue of what is happening there, and after 30 minutes of back and forth it is clear they're not willing to help (I don't blame them, they probably make 30k a year or whatever). They tell me to check the carousel in the destination. Kick the can down the road, baby! Haha. Nope, not there! Filed a claim immediately with the bag claim. Got a file number. Now it's the next day. Of course that file reference number doesn't work in the Delta system. Here we go trying to get customer support. \"Wait time is expected to be 3 hours and 42 minutes\" . Yay....\n\n**I did not cherry pick these cases** \\- These are the last 6 flights I had experience with. All of them had me apprehensive, running for my life, experiencing grueling sleep deprivation and uncertainty, dealing with their faulty, understaffed, poorly-trained systems that have nobody willing to think at all to deal with exceptions. It is a systemic issue and there's nothing to do about it.\n\nThey got a brilliant technology and transformed it into crap. The only way to protest is to not travel by plane - and I'm doing that right now. I'll drive from LA to NY, I don't care anymore. \n\nSo, all in all, I'm a happy man now; because I accepted that flying is not an option. Hopefully you'll realize that - either by reading people's experiences like mine, or by going through them yourself. And we will all hog the lanes of the highways together and make road travel as miserable in the future!", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Before the storm was my normal 2 days off.   I basically got four days at home.  Half were snow days where I didn't do anything, but it was really nice.   At my job I feel like I can never call out.  Other than this snow, I have called out exactly 2 times in the last year. When I was dealing with a domestic violence situation? No, we need you to come in despite your crying on the phone.   Oh? You are waiting on someone surgery and spending the night in the hospital with them? You can still come in right? You're running a fever and throwing up? Sorry but you'll be here to close right?  I can not call in.   It's like I'm not allowed. And, I know that if I even when I do manage to, I'm terrified of just being taken off the schedule and basically fired.  I've seen him do it for people missing 2 days of work.   \n\nThere's more to it.  He thinks he's the fast food Jesus. He is always saying I will never be as good as him or that he never makes mistakes.  If you catch him making a mistake, it wasn't him, it was improper communication.

The other two were hired by my boss but other than those two he hired actual idiots, ones that can not grasp the ability to make pizza dough into a circle.   Idiots that think sauce goes all the way to the edges of the pizza leaving no crust.  We don't get new hires.  They do not stick around because they're idiots and my boss is very mean to them for being idiots.  It's understandable by his hiring practice that there are only 2 people who can close the store.  Me and my boss.  We technically have one other pe won but my boss never lets them open or close.   \n\nMeaning, that because I didn't want to risk my car getting to work, my boss worked 4 doubles in a row.  Because he won't let the other person we have close or open, he worked 4 doubles and is pissed.   \n\nLong story short? I want to quit and depending on how he treats me when I come in tonight?

{"post": {"title": "Private unions are good, and if you believe otherwise, you are so clearly brainwashed by the rich and powerful businesspeople who obviously wanted to manipulate you.", "id": "1hz1dni", "created_utc": 1736617684.0, "selftext": "If we sat down and made a good-faith effort to decide on which criteria we would use to answer the question of \"are unions a net benefit for society\", we would almost certainly decide on these things: wages, benefits, hours, and employee safety. Get paid, get reasonable benefits, work reasonable hours, don't get hurt. I think everyone could agree: these categories are the best categories we could use to measure whether private unions are doing the world good.\n\nSo, on that front:\n\n* **Wages:** Union workers make more money than non-union workers. ([Source](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf))\n* **Benefits:** Unions have greater benefits than non-union members, particularly when it comes to healthcare expenses ([Source](https://chirblog.org/the-impact-of-unions-on-employer-sponsored-health-insurance/))\n* **Hours:** It is illegal for union members to be forced to work mandatory overtime ([Source](https://www.joinhomebase.com/blog/is-mandatory-overtime-legal)). Unions recognize the deleterious consequences of excessive and unusual work hours and continually work to address those problems ([Source](https://teamster.org/overtime-and-extended-work-shifts-injuries-illnesses-and-other-effects/)).\n* **Employee safety:** A recent study of the construction industry showed that union worksites were 19% less likely to have OSHA violations and had 34% fewer OSHA violations per inspection ([Source](https://blog.dol.gov/2022/05/11/the-connection-between-unions-and-worker-safety)). 80% of union contractors conduct hazard analyses at the start of a job, compared to 56% of non-union contractors ([Source](http://osha10hrtraining.com/blog/worker-safety-articles/worker-safety-and-unions/)). Unionized workers have 14% fewer lost workday claims, 29% fewer claims for \"critical incidents\" in comparison to non-union workers ([Source](https://lhsfna.org/study-confirms-that-the-union-safety-advantage-is-real-2/)).\n\nThese things are all more important than the other stupid crap I see people bring up. Yes, better wages, better benefits, better work protections are indeed more important than the fact that a union rep is kind of an asshole and that one guy who you don't like and who doesn't work very hard gets to keep his job. The perfect solution does not exist, and everything in life comes at some cost, so pointing out the existence of something undesirable here and there is not, in and of itself, a good argument. You'd have to prove that somehow those things matter more than making more money, having good access to benefits, and being protected as an employee. (Hint: gonna be a real fuckin' tall order for you to make a case like that!)\n\nIf you seriously still think private unions are bad, then wow, have the rich and powerful ever pulled the wool over your eyes. You fell for their bullshit, hook, line, and sinker. You don't really think they wouldn't have tried to push against unions, would you? Unions are bad for the rich because they don't get to exploit their workers as much, squeeze every ounce out of them that they can for their own benefit. Like, just, who the fuck do you think cares more about the working person in this equation: the actual fucking working person, or the one in charge of him? And you're deferring to the rhetoric of the one in ***charge?*** Like, you have GOT to be FUCKING KIDDING ME.

I hate to say it but I worry we won\u2019t be together for much longer if he doesn\u2019t change.

He seriously needs to be held accountable and I do frequently tell him that his behavior is not ok, but it\u2019s getting to a standstill where I just need him to get help. \n\nI also suspect he honestly has an addiction to sex. He feels unattractive if we don\u2019t have sex, even if I do nice things for him, cook for him, or say nice things to him. Like we\u2019ve had times where we\u2019ve been intimate 3-4 times or so in the week, and it\u2019s still not enough for him. \n\nWe even considered a 3rd, but he gets exceptionally anxious if they don\u2019t want to meet up within a week or so.

While the right strongly supports Israel, the left has been at the forefront of many large protests for peace in Palestine. California, in particular, has been a hub of pro-Palestinian activism.   They are one of your biggest allies in the U.S., holding protests, raising awareness, and fighting for Palestine\u2019s cause.

As the new year has begun, each of our team has to present a few new ideas/policies to our CEO for this year.\n\nI report to a VP of HR  at my company and since he wanted me to have some exposure, he asked me to present our team's policies. To be honest, I was super excited and terrified at the same time.\n\nExcited, since non of my team members at my level (5 years of total professional experience) had interacted with our CEO and terrified because he had a reputation to shout at people even for small things (foreshadowing).\n\nOur new policies are nothing extraordinary, to be fair, it was something we put together just to start some kinda conversation with him and build over it, as these policies will go through 8-10 iterations before getting approved. A catch was that, I was asked to take the call just 20 mins before the scheduled time and I wasn't ready in terms of getting my laptop set. My laptop is 3 years old, got it when I joined the company and it was already a refurbished one. It usually is slow and the charge drains quickly (100 to 0 in less than 2 hrs). I went into the call pretty much on the terrified side.\n\nI went to the call with a Account Manager as well. It was a 30 mins call. The account manager hijacked 15 mins of the call at the beginning. I was a bit relieved about it. When he happen to finish his interactions with the CEO. The CEO turned to me and asked \"why are you in my room?\". I replied to him that I was a part of the HR team and came to present the new policies. He again asked me, \"then why the fuck have you not started presenting it yet?\". I immediately started to present my screen to show him a PowerPoint we prepared for this. Since my laptop was slow, it took a bit for the PowerPoint to come on the conference room screen. He plainly asked me if I was a moron for it not coming up on the screen. I politely replied that my laptop is a bit slow. He rudely told me that it was my problem and not his and I was wasting his time. He called me a noob, a moron and an asshole in a single sentence.\n\nI was taken back a bit and began to panic. I started to present our policies and unfortunately around the fag end of my presentation my laptop turned off from battery drainage. I took it with 80% 35 mins ago. He didn't even look at me and just said, \"this fucker is definitely a moron coming here with his dumb retarted laptop\". To be fair, it technically was his laptop, company issued. Then, he said, \"why are you still here, fuck off. You either have no skills or your laptop is very bad but I personally think you are a dumb asshole. Now fuck off my room\"\n\nAs I was leaving the conference room, the account manager I was with told me that I will get used to it and I shouldn't have panicked because the CEO sensed my panic. WTF?? Am I in the forest with a tiger or what? He also told me that the CEO might escalate it with my manager. So I went to my manager straight an told him what happened. He is a very understanding person. He understood what had happened and asked meto forget it. \n\nBut it keeps running in my head. It happened 3 days ago and it still bothers me. My team members are actually envious that I happen to attend a meeting with the CEO despite me saying what transpired. Only one of my junior told me that he doesn't want to stay in this company to reach my level just to avoid such an interaction.\n\nYesterday my manager told me that he has requested to get me a macbook so that my next call with the CEO, whenever that is to happen won't be an issue. \n\nStill I don't like that stupid guy to call me by names when the issue was not mine.

I get it. Adoption is great in theory, and I appreciate anyone who is commited to giving these animals a loving home and helping them. But the way people act like it\u2019s the only acceptable option is downright ridiculous. \n\nA rescue dog isn\u2019t just a cute, wholesome Instagram story waiting to happen. It\u2019s often a huge responsibility\u2014one that not everyone is equipped to handle. You don\u2019t know what the dog has been through. Was it abused? Neglected? Abandoned? These things leave scars, and they can manifest in ways that are hard to deal with\u2014fear, aggression, destructive behavior, anxiety. Not everyone has the time, resources, or emotional bandwidth to help a traumatized dog heal. That doesn\u2019t make someone a bad person. It just means they\u2019re being realistic about their limitations.\n\nI\u2019ve seen this nonsense play out in real life with my aunt. She\u2019s the poster child for why \u201cadopt, don\u2019t shop\u201d isn\u2019t always the fairy tale people like to pretend it is. The first dog she adopted had no impulse control whatsoever. One day, it bolted straight into the street and got hit by a car. It was devastating, and yeah, she wasn\u2019t to blame exactly, but it\u2019s a brutal reminder that taking on a rescue isn\u2019t always something you can fix with love and good intentions.\n\nThen came the second dog, also a rescue. This one came from a litter in a dog shelter where the mother had been through hell and back, and apparently, trauma is hereditary, because this dog has been a nightmare from day one. It\u2019s aggressive. It\u2019s unpredictable. It trusts nobody except my aunt. She\u2019s thrown everything at trying to help it: trainers, behaviorists, medications, special programs. You name it, nothing worked. The dog is so aggressive and unpredictable that it has to be kept on a leash at all times and can\u2019t be trusted around anyone but my aunt. It\u2019s heartbreaking because, as much as she loves this dog, her life has been completely consumed by trying to manage its behavior. She can\u2019t have people over, she can\u2019t take the dog to normal parks, and every walk is an exercise in hyper-vigilance to avoid triggering the dog.\n\nAnd yet, if someone were to look at that and say, \u201cYou know what, I don\u2019t think I can handle a rescue,\u201d they\u2019d immediately get shamed for daring to consider a breeder. Why? Responsible breeders exist for a reason! They\u2019re out there ensuring that dogs are healthy, well-socialized, and have predictable temperaments so that people can find a pet that actually fits their lives. But no, the \u201cadopt, don\u2019t shop\u201d warriors can\u2019t handle that. To them, it\u2019s all black and white: adoption good, shopping bad. Never mind the fact that pushing people to adopt dogs they\u2019re not ready for is how you end up with even more traumatized animals being rehomed over and over again.\n\nThis mindset is not just ignorant, it\u2019s harmful. Adopting a dog isn\u2019t about virtue signaling or looking good on social media. It\u2019s a huge responsibility. If you\u2019re not prepared to deal with a worst-case scenario like my aunt\u2019s, you\u2019re not helping anyone, not yourself, not the dog. And guess what? That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not a moral failing to admit you\u2019re not cut out for a rescue. It\u2019s called being responsible. The most important thing is giving a dog a safe, loving home, whether that\u2019s through adoption or a breeder.\n\nSo can we please stop with the sanctimonious \u201cadopt, don\u2019t shop\u201d crap? It\u2019s not helping the conversation, and it\u2019s definitely not helping the dogs.

There is NOTHING sexual or anything like that about this post. Simply put: a stranger decided that I didn\u2019t look threatening or weird and sat next to me on the bus.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like a big deal, really, does it? You\u2019re probably thinking the only seat left was next to me, right? There were plenty of seats available, and she didn\u2019t even check upstairs.\n\nI\u2019m not exactly a heartthrob looker. I\u2019d say I\u2019m average and definitely wasn\u2019t dressed to impress this morning. Thick navy joggers, muddy trainers and a black sports coat keep me warm, rather than impressive. Though I did style my hair, which was nice! Yeah, my self-esteem can be pretty low at times.\n\nFrom as early as I can remember, until I was about 17, I was always called \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d and all that kind of stuff. The opposite of \u2018pretty privilege\u2019, though I did get to experience pretty privilege when I was about 18-22. I\u2019m 31 now and past my peak. Before then, people would always try to avoid me, especially women. Don\u2019t want to be seen next to the ugly kid at school, I\u2019m sure you get what I mean.\n\nAnyways, the point is that I kinda view that last statement as the way things work when people choose who to sit next to on the bus. If there\u2019s no opportunity to sit alone, you have to quickly scan who\u2019s sitting and decide who the least threatening person is. I believe we all do that. A woman wouldn\u2019t want to sit next to a man who\u2019d suddenly start touching her leg, and a man wouldn\u2019t want to sit next to a woman who\u2019d start making false accusations. Both scenarios are unlikely, but I started this rant with a reference to that whole \u201cchoose the bear over the man\u201d thing that went round of social media a couple years back.\n\nSo this woman gets on the bus and she\u2019s got to make that decision: she wants to sit next to someone who\u2019s quiet, doesn\u2019t smell bad and will leave her alone. Sat right in front of me is another woman, so my assumption would be that she\u2019d just sit next to her: she doesn\u2019t have to walk as far to sit there, and a woman is arguably considered less threatening than a man. Instead, she goes right past her and sits next to me.\n\nNo words are spoken, no glances, nothing. She sits, and 2 stops later I get off the bus. You\u2019ve just read a rant about nothing\u2026 kind of.\n\nAfter everything I went through as a child and adolescent, moments like these truly mean a lot to me. You can say \u201cshe didn\u2019t think about it that much\u201d and \u201cshe just sat in a seat, it\u2019s meaningless\u201d as much as you want, but I do believe we make either conscious or subconscious decisions about who we sit next to on the bus. You will choose the least threatening option. You could also partially argue people also consider appearance/attractiveness too, but this is VERY minor: basically, I believe she\u2019d have sat elsewhere if I were hideously ugly.\n\nThrough what was likely a subconscious decision, I was made to feel\u2026 I dunno, it\u2019s hard to explain in this moment as I write this\u2026 it just made me feel a bit better about myself. I don\u2019t feel any more or less attractive than before, she wasn\u2019t giving me any signals beyond \u201cyou don\u2019t look threatening\u201d.

I have the publications searchable on google scholar to prove it.\n\nIt's like this: I recently got this murder mystery game for Christmas, which came with this stack of clues to sift through and analyze in order to determine who the killer is. Included with this package is an envelope that reveals who the killer really is. Imagine if, before I even started sifting through anything, the very first thing I did was open that envelope and learn the identity of the killer. That would spoil the entire experience, right?\n\nWhat people don't get about scientists is that we love the mystery. The fun is learning something about the world, something that we don't think anyone else has yet learned, hopefully. But the whole process of working through what we know and then learning something new and fascinating in the end is the fun part.\n\nYet, for some reason, people legitimately think that scientists would rather open that envelope at the very beginning and just spoil the entire experience. Why the fuck would we do that? Why would we not be careful and diligent in setting up a proper experiment that does indeed net us the exact kind of results we are looking for? Why the fuck would we do some liberal thing that gives us liberal results that furthers our liberal agenda, instead of doing the scientific thing where our experiment is completely unbiased and fair and accurate and the results we get back are real? You don't even fucking understand scientists if you think we'd ever have any interest in doing shit like that. As if we want to open up an Agatha Christie novel and read the last 5 pages and just ruin the rest of that classic book. Do you not know what fun is?\n\nBut honestly, I get why the folks who try very badly to dunk on scientists do what they do. They don't really understand how a person can have intellectual fun. They don't understand how mind-related challenges could ever be enjoyable because they just aren't good at that sort of thing, and so they project this viewpoint that nobody could ever possibly get enjoyment and satisfaction out of solving mysteries, because mysteries are hard, man, and who is smart enough to solve them?

When it arrived, I inspected the box before accepting it; it appeared in great condition. I opened the outer box and when I pulled out the box of the actual product, I noticed immediately that this box had been damaged. Ok, no big deal. Shit happens and although it had obvious damage it appeared that the box took the brunt of the damage so I was optimistic about the contents. I opened the box and it still looked undamaged then I got to the bottom of the box where I found a small piece of broken plastic. I inspect the device and finally see where that piece of plastic belonged. It was a piece of the reservoir cap that had been broken off when the box sustained damage. After further inspection, I determined it was just an aesthetic issue and wouldn't prevent me from using the device.\n\nI am a reasonable person and understand that sometimes this sort of thing happens so I took a little time to decide how to proceed. I would have been happy with a $10 Amazon gift card since it was only aesthetic damage, but that wasn't an option. It was obvious that the devices box had sustained crush damage at some point before it was placed in the shipping box since the shipping box was in perfect condition. Had the damage been caused by UPS/USPS or Fedex I would have probably just ignored the damage and used it; it was only a $60 purchase so it's not a huge issue to me. Since someone at Amazon (or a robot) damaged my purchase and then decided to ship it anyway, I felt that they were obligated to make it right. So I called Amazon and they said no problem, another one is on the way. It still hasn't arrived, however, I did receive something else from Amazon via Email today. They seem to be under the impression that they are going to send me a shipping label and then I am going to get into my car, drive to the other side of town, and then stand in line for 20-minutes so I can ship the one that's broken back to them.\n\nAm I being unreasonable in thinking they should be sending me a shipping label and then scheduling a UPS/USPS/Fedex pickup at my house? Why would I be willing to put in all that effort to return a broken product that someone working in the warehouse QA department should have caught before shipping it out? Is this a thing? Is this what people are expected to do now? I am astounded that they expect me to do this for them but I have spoken to a family member about the situation and she is acting like I am making it into a bigger deal than it is.\n\n", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Similar to how having a really fast car doesn\u2019t make you get to work any faster during rush hour.\n\nSecond, climate change. \nElectric cars will still be producing an excessive amount of emissions, the only difference is that it is produced away from the vehicle at the production plants for both the vehicles and electricity. Yes, in the long run and electric vehicle will produce less missions than a gas vehicle on average, but it\u2019s not by a significant margin. At least not a significant enough one to ban gas vehicles.\n\nOnto self driving. \n\nSelf driving cars will still have a very significant trunk of the existing traffic, and still have all of the extra risks of a car compared to say a tram. Especially when it comes to pedestrian safety. You can easily and comfortably walk 2 feet to the side of tram tracks in a city because that tram is not going to come off the tracks. Doing that around any car, self driving or not, at minimum *feels* like a death wish.\n\nNot only that, and I know that by the numbers it is irrational, but I trust most 17-year-old new drivers more than a computer program.\n\nFinally, mental health. \n\nEven if you are a car enthusiast, daily driving a car in miserably slow traffic all the time sucks. However, riding a bike to work has been statistically, proven to improve peoples\u2019 mental health.\n\nThe solution to all of it? Viable alternatives to driving. Not just bikes, but also various modes of public transportation. My personal favorite is variations of trains because you know they aren\u2019t going to go off the path and they\u2019re just cool. \u201cI like trains\u201d became a meme for a reason, deep down everybody likes trains. \n\nBut even buses would be an improvement if implemented correctly. \n\nThank you for coming to my unscripted TEDTalk, I\u2019m moving to the Netherlands one day.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

My parents are pushing me to get a job in my area, saying I can\u2019t put all my effort into voice acting. I know in the back of my mind that they\u2019re right, but it feels humiliating knowing what I want to do, and looking for a job that I know I wouldn\u2019t want in the long run. I\u2019m honestly at a loss of what to do in my career next, and it\u2019s hurting me so much to the point where I\u2019m in tears just by typing this out.

In my line of work, I get a lot of compassion fatigue.  That said, what happened to empathy?

What are their reasons for doing that?\n\n- Why they cornered the children.

What are his reasons?\n\n- Why Mr. Banks was trying to stop the children (I mean, this question seems logical but not for me).\n\n- Why clients panicked/tried to withdraw everything/are selfish?\n\n- Why the bankers sent a guard after Michael grabbed the tuppence of the Chairman\u2019s hand without being noticed and fled with Jane and ran away from the bank?\n\n- Why the children ran away?\n\n\nLike this kind of questions I want to analyze in a psychological way and understand.\n\nAdd that the part of the pleasure myself is on the bank run.

After my divorce, my Fleshlight \"Creampuff\", became my \"Wilson\" (from the movie \"Cast Away\"). I know it\u2019s messed up, but I have to admit it to myself. It\u2019s the truth, and I can\u2019t ignore it anymore.\n\nBecause my life realy relates to the plot in Cast Away. I watched the movie some days ago, and at the end of the movie I was crying like a fucking idiot. Would I ever believe that Tom Hanks stranded on a deserted island would hit so close to my very own heart? That volleyball Wilson, he wasn't just a ball for him \u2014 he was Hanks\u2019 last bit of sanity. And that\u2019s exactly what \"Creampuff\" is for me. My Wilson. My lifeline. And the last bit of memory of my ex wife's presence on my soul. Wilson was some sort of therapist ball for Tom Hanks. \"Creampuff\" is a silicone therapist for me.\n\n\nI bought my Fleshlight, Creampuff, almost a year and half ago, long before the divorce. At first, she was just a new sex toy in my possession\u2014something to use when my desires got too loaded. For me to use when my sexual urges utperformed a gangbang at a frat house, or when my imagination spiraled to the deepest part of Mordor and to dark to admit out loud.  My ex-wife was ok with it, the Fleshlight. She got me one for Christmas in the Christmas sock one year (Ridley Reid version if anyone interested). But what she didn\u2019t know was that I had a few other toys hidden away in the hunting room of the house \u2014 sex dolls I\u2019d spent a small fortune of money on. And then, one day, she found out. Life kicked me hard in the balls. The glass house of my life cracked, I fell into the fires of Mount Doom, and Creampuff transformed into something entirely different for me.\n\n\nAs of now, she is my version of Wilson. She has become something similar to Wilson in \"Cast Away\". Wilson is not just a companion, he\u2019s proof that you\u2019re not totally fucking insane. Creampuff of course, didn\u2019t wash up on a deserted island, but she has definitely been my anchor since my life own life cracked apart.. She\u2019s been with me through every lonely night since the divorce. Every mountain hike. Every panic attack. There she is like a solid rock, just like my ex wife was for me. \n\nCreampuff is just now, my only constant thing in life. She sits on my desk at my computer, is in my bag while hiking, she lays in my bed when I sleep and spice thing up when the nights get too quiet. She can't talk, doesn\u2019t ask me any questions, and she doesn\u2019t give a shit about my broken heart. But that\u2019s the point of it. Understand? She\u2019s not supposed to be. She\u2019s just ment to be there for me. And sometimes, that\u2019s all I need.\n\nMy ex-wife was my princess. She was a perfect combination of smart in a little nerdy way, sweet looking smile and laughter. She was the loud talkeactive one of us. I'm more of a silent book reading guy with some personal issues on top. So you can say, she was out of my league. I miss her more than you can imagine. Creampuff doesn\u2019t do any of that. She\u2019s not talking, she\u2019s not sharp, she doesn\u2019t make me laugh or scream when she sees a spider. But when the world\u2019s falling apart around me, she\u2019s my solid rock. And in a fucked-up kind of way, she\u2019s the only reminder of the relationship I had before everything fell apart. It\u2019s not always about the sex. Sometimes, it\u2019s just the quiet company. She\u2019s like a my mute therapist that doesn\u2019t judge.\n\n\nWhile watching \"Cast Away\" and the following days, I thought alot about that moment towards the end, where Wilson floated away. Tom Hanks was screaming, begging for him to come back. But Wilson never returned as you might expect. It wasn't a happy ending relationship ending. And then it hit me like a punch to my stomach \u2014 what the hell happens if I lose Creampuff? What if one day reach after for her, and she\u2019s suddenly gone? What if she breakes beyond repair. Will I actually scream for her? Have I come to that point of obsession over a thing that I cant afford to lose it? \n\nOr maybe, if something were to happen to Creampuff, it wouldn\u2019t be the end. Watching \"Cast Away\" wasn\u2019t just a punch to my stomach; it was a reminder that even if you lose something, you can still find a way to keep your life going. Tom Hanks didn\u2019t end up staying lost on that island forever. Maybe I won\u2019t either. He got out of his problem!\n\nCreampuff might be my Wilson now, but that doesn't mean she has to be forever. One day, I hope to replace the silence of silicone sex toy with the laughter of someone real. Someone who doesn\u2019t just tolerate my quirks but embraces them. Until then, I\u2019ll hold on to that tiny bit of hope, because; even in the darkest nights, there\u2019s always hope\u2014like Samwise the brave said, \"even darkness must pass, and a new day will come.\"\n\nI\u2019m not okay. I know this shit isn\u2019t healthy. But for now, this is all I\u2019ve got\u2014 its me, Creampuff, and that little hope that someday, I hopefully find my own way out off this island. Until then, it\u2019s just the two of us. And maybe, in this godforsaken world, that\u2019s enough...\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nI fucked up my life so badly that after watching the movie \"Cast Away\" I had a breakdown realizing that my Fleshlight, Creampuff, is my \"Wilson\". She\u2019s been my lifeline since my divorce \u2014 a weird mix of comfort, obsession, and therapy. It\u2019s not healthy for me, I know, but right now, she\u2019s all I have while I try to find a way off this metaphorical island.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Great supervisor, I was good at my work, liked my coworkers, etcetera.\n\nThen my supervisor retired.  Under her replacement, suddenly my accuracy rate was determined to be well below acceptable levels and I was repeatedly reprimanded for all kinds of things.\n\nOne day I got an email saying that there was an issue with my Outlook Calendar.  We work an 8-5 so, on Fridays, at 5-5:30 I had a task set.  It was just a set of cycling \"one liners\" like, \"Friday, is that you?  I missed you.\" and \"Weekend, here I come!\"  I was told that it was unprofessional, interfered with scheduling, and I was ordered to remove the entries.\n\nIt wasn't too long before she found the opportunity to \"trade me\" to another team in the office.  Same cubicle block, just different responsibilities under a different supervisor.  Amazingly, I had no accuracy issues and the only discipline I got was for being \"Too jovial\" with clients (basically don't crack jokes on the phone.)\n\nThen that supervisor lost their shit, went out on psych leave, and had to be moved to an office in another city.  It wasn't their fault, the work environment had started to turn toxic.\n\nI go through a half dozen supervisors in a year.   While under one of them I ended up out on a 90 day psych leave.  When I returned, she wasn't my supervisor anymore and said to me in the break area, \"I'm sorry for all the things they made me do to you.\"\n\nNow I've been under a semi-permanent supervisor for the past year.  She is nice enough but can't evaluate employees for shit.  Three people have quit under her and two have been fired (for poor accuracy,)  The two of us left keep being told (for a whole year) that we're constantly on the verge of being fired for not meeting accuracy standards.  We compare notes...our conferences are IDENTICAL.  Like, copy and paste.\n\nA couple of weeks ago we had a safety inspection.  On Monday my coworker and I were told that our \"overhead\" space in our cubicles were cluttered and unsafe and had to be cleared.  My coworker had her source materials (4 binders) in her overhead...you know, where they're supposed to be stored...  I, on the other hand, have a cabinet and then next to it is a shelf.  The shelf is to my left and is eye level when I'm SITTING.  If I were to reach out my arm, I could touch ONE item on the shelf that actually overlaps my body space.  The rest of the shelf is to the left of me.  There is no way that any of the objects except a toy car could have impacted me if it fell and it would have fallen 20\" by the time it \"crushed\" my fingers.  It contained my coffee mug collection and a few, small nick nacks.  I was told to clear it.\n\nSo now I have a SHELF with nothing on it because apparently shelves are not intended to have things placed on them.  I realized today how often I glance up at that shelf just for a moment of mental shift from the drab gray walls of my cubicle, the flickering fluorescent lights, and the mind numbing computer monitors in front of me.\n\nEvery month I'm reminded that my job could be terminated at any time due to my supervisor's personal interpretation of policy.  I've been made to remove my entries from outlook celebrating the coming weekend.  I've been made to remove my personal affects from my cubicle. I've literally been told not to be nice to customers and not to explain things like policies and contractual requirements to them.  Our office is staffed with 4 workers but is supposed to be staffed by 8 but due to non competitive wages, toxic environment, and a feigned budget crisis, they aren't able to hire more.  So 4 of us are struggling to do the work of 8 and are constantly being told we're not working fast enough and aren't being accurate enough.\n\nAnd I'm trapped.  I have three household members with chronic, lifelong, genetic health issues.  They can't work full time and they can't go without medications.  So I keep clinging to my job for the medical benefits and so that we won't lose our home.

It's like she's always trying to out non-chalant me (which is honestly, VERY easy!!!) or try to keep up a mysterious and uncaring persona, but it is so BS. IDK what she wants to achieve, but she'll shoo me away, or avoid eye contact while I talk to her, or even skip over shit I say as if its unimportant when we're in public.

The incentives within society dictate that autonomous form factors of robotic entities will be a reality in the very near future, because they are cheaper and more efficient at work.\n\nSo, I'm asking people to stop thinking so linearly. Accept (even momentarily) that the world has fundamentally shifted under their feet, and recognize that a new reality has taken over their world, and they need to deal with it practically.\n\nBecause we don't have decades for this to percolate into physical reality in my opinion. We have 5-10 years max, and likely much, much less time. And the next generation (as in Gen Z) entering the workforce sure as shit aren't going to escape these consequences, let alone Gen alpha.\n\nAnd remember, if you have a physical job then your wages are about to get seriously depressed for the following reasons:\n\n1. If people insist on maintaining a monetary system, even when 80+ percent of productivity is automated, then the influx of workers into \"physical jobs\" will result in increased supply, resulting in depressed wages. That's just supply and demand.\n2. Immigration will further depress wages on the top and bottom throughout the curve.\n3. Robots *will* continue to take physical world jobs at an increasing rate, likely at an exponential rate while this is happening, causing even more productivity supply and less demand for human \"work\", because it is less efficient.\n\nSo, In my view, people are living in a fantasy right now in believing that they'll still have a \"job\" or that they can just \"figure it out\" or \"diversify\" lol. Instead, we need to get off our asses and start working to make sure this world doesn't turn to shit, particularly from keeping all of our resources in the hands of a few governments, when those resources are no longer being generated by anything other than machines.\n\nBut honestly, based on the conversations I see going on, most people are more concerned with maintaining the current capital systems than actually reckoning with the reality that those systems no longer serve any other function other than to concentrate the world's natural resources into a few hands for no practical reason, other than hoarding and greed.\n\nBut, most people seem happy as pie to keep perpetuating this clearly broken system, because it's how you \"put food on the table\". Honestly it is frustrating to watch people see this new, transformative technology spreading across the planet, that can eliminate all need for mental and physical work - and people still complain about how they'll need their jobs to eat (jobs they claim they ostensibly hate lol). It's like we're so conditioned to be work slaves for our right to exist, that it doesn't occur to us that it is no longer necessary. And instead of reorienting our society to reflect that change, we're fighting to make sure we keep the shackles on. Freaking institutionalization is what it is in my opinion, and it is really sad frankly.\n\nAnd it's not like it's new! This system is stealing 70+% of your productivity output to service itself. Imagine what you could have done with 70+% of your own efforts - Imagine what your family's life could have been over the last couple of decades. And if we don't get off our lazy asses and do something about it, it will be 90+% to 99+% in the very near future.\n\nBut, I guess we're just waiting for the big government, or some \"authority\", to swoop down and tell us *how* these new advancements will affect us lol, instead of organizing ourselves, educating ourselves, and helping ourselves and our communities. Because let's be real, people haven't been taking responsibility for themselves or their communities for decades now in my opinion.\n\nIt's disappointing to be frank, but what's new about this planet? Are we just a bunch of consuming lemmings that can't think for our selves and organize our world to our/and the future's advantage any longer? I guess we'll find out lol.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I would go out of my way to help this woman. I even took her to have shoulder surgery, picked her up and took her home, helped her with her physical therapy, helped her with laundry and cleaning, and run errands for her. I went out of my way to get her son to treat her more respectfully and even a nice little heart to heart with her about it. Well here's the problem. She(67F) is a certified narcissistic, neurotic, bitch! According her now, I've never been nice to her or done anything for her and I just take advantage of her. She's also very petty, vindictive, and immature. I mean, it's pretty bad when someone half your age feels more mature than a grandmother! She recently got scammed by some Nigerian asshole and she fell for it twice in a span of a couple months. She's desperate for attention bc she hasn't had a relationship in 10 years. My issue is, she says it to her son like \"well I'm sorry no one has dated me in 10 years\" like she had no control over it. She CHOSE to close herself off and always said she didn't want a relationship. She's already sent money to them twice. Well, obviously, my husband and I were, rightfully, concerned and wanted to talk to her about it and of course we warned her about certain things online. I told her that continuing to talk to those guys online was a dangerous game to play. Well after that, last night while I'm on my way home, they're at home bickering. I get home and walk in and apparently right before I did, she had just told my husband, unprompted, \"And I don't need to be lectured from someone who's been married three times.\" He was rather upset bc he knew about my marriages. My first one basically changed his mind and didn't want to be with me anymore, and the second went to prison after being psychologically, emotionally, and physically abusive. She's been married once to an abusive dick before too, so she really doesn't have any room to talk. I've never once said anything her relationships, or judged her for any of her actions. Even though she's already talked shit about me in the past, I've still continued to go out of my way to be nice to her. Tonight it's \"you've never been nice to me\" and \"y'all just take advantage of me.\" Her complete lack of self-awareness or fault is just mind boggling. She's so damn judgmental too. We're, unfortunately, stuck in the same house with her until we can afford to gtfo. I'm about ready to start living in my car at this point. That's how messed up this bitch has me. Oh yeah! The constant, having things move places or change packages and it's never her fault, even though there's only 3 people in this house and other 2 most definitely did not do it. She will absolutely refuse to admit that she might have forgotten about something. It's just absolutely mind boggling when you're in the middle of it. Like last when everyone was arguing, she made a comment that I \"wouldn't stop talking shit.\" I had, at the time, been eating in the kitchen scrolling on my phone and I was \"I haven't been talking for like the last 5 mins. You're the one who hasn't stopped talking since I walked in the door, and YOU are the one who threw the first (proverbial) punch. She is the most miserable woman I have ever met.

{"post": {"title": "I am convinced that I'm doomed to less than mediocrity.", "id": "1hvjodf", "created_utc": 1736225199.0, "selftext": "Essentially, I'm a nearly 30 year old man who (thanks to ''family'' who hit me with 27 years of financial, emotional and psychological abuse) has never had a job, and is currently trying to find a form of employment that will allow me to begin working on my goal in life (or one of them at least). The problem is, this is proving to be nigh impossible for me.\n\nTo start off, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at the age of 15, and even afterwards, did not receive any support from anyone, be they the government, or my own family/friends. Where most people would have went through their schooling/post schooling period, gaining *some* form of work experience, I did not. My family did their absolute best to try and force me to be dependent on them so that I would *have* to look after them in their old age (quite how they expected that to work when they never taught me how to do anything that a person is effectively *required* to learn in order to be a functional adult, I have no idea). With that said, I recently read a report on the employment rate of people in my country that have ASD, and found that 7/10 are long term unemployed, and the 3/10 that have found employment, are working in either A) voluntary positions (that don't get any form of monetary reimbursement for their work), B) zero-hour contracts (where there is evidence of those with ASD actively not being able to get enough hours to pay their bills thanks to the inherent bias of their managers) or C) are in positions for which they are VASTLY overqualified. The fact that this report was published as recently as February of 2024 is disheartening to say the least and makes me think that my prospects of finding employment AT ALL are slim to none.\n\nThe second issue concerning that is the place I live. I didn't choose to live here, it was simply the first place I found that I was able to move into, and having to move here or be out on the street. The town in which I live is GREAT, for ''normal'' people, but TERRIBLE for people like me. Every job that is available in the local area is retail or some other customer/public facing job that I would struggle with (and that's not just coming from me, that's coming from my fianc\u00e9e and friends who have worked in retail themselves and know the ins and outs of such a position). To those who would suggest ''just get a work from home position, duh'', I would like to add that A) those positions are already highly sought after by ''normal'' people due to better work-life balance and generally better working conditions (not having to commute, for example), and B) many of them require at least a few days per week in office, or require employees to have worked there for a period of time before they are permitted to WFH.\n\nAll the above to say, despite having a plan for what I want to do with my life, and despite having the desire to find a job to achieve the first objective towards reaching my goal, I fear that I may end up being stuck with the pittance I am given every month by my country's government and even if they suddenly decided to grant me the additional benefit that would drastically help me out (which they wont because I ''don't qualify'' due to the fact I don't need a carer to help me keep up on my personal hygiene, can cook for myself and am capable of walking down the street to the shop), I would still be forced to live out the rest of my life in a position of less than mediocrity, given that even ''mediocre'' people can at least find employment and can afford to feed themselves every day.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Count the murders of corporate greed to their slaves we the people wallowing in our serfdom of pretty scraps we drool for.\n Heck not just Americans it's the human condition and always has been.\nI truly wonder if a murder is done with a pen, how many hands must it pass through before it's no longer murder and just corporate turnaround. Just some model middle management you could say. \nYou know what I think is the worst part of it all though. The soul crushing crazy idea that flits through my head. The utterly unbelievable thought that after this all blows over nothing will have changed.\n That's what really sucks. People dying every day so someone kills in their names or maybe just to make his own name famous and we all find novelty or outcry in it for a short while, but what will truly happen is most will go back to our daily lives putting one foot in front of the other serving our Lords and masters just so we can have a few more scraps.\n Fighting to have a roof over our heads and food in our bellies because our rules are decided by people who suck on the tit of greed and most have never experienced true hardship. Yet they sit in their mansions telling those of us living on a tenth if not less of what they make annually how to live.\n How is it any different than past times other than our basic necessities are slightly higher and there are more of us to serve them. We may not serve them directly but we serve their economy in an ever turning cycle to feed ourselves while the fastest sit at the top plucking the most from our earnings as we work. \nWe are trapped in our own illusion of security from a system that cares. When truly it cares as much as a slave driver cares that it has workers to maintain their crops. They care enough for us to keep us under heel. They will pretend that our best interests are their intent and play us against one another based on moralities and ideals of freedom simply to distract us from the truth. \nThey don't truly care about us at the heart of it. They may like to even lie to themselves and say they do but it's only to assuage their own sense of morality if they even have any at all.  It's all truly laughable.\n\n We're all crazy\n We're all mad\n A thimblefull of sanity\n is all we ever had.\n\n\"Circus contraption\"\n ", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Asked said friend and recieved no forgiveness despite bringing up our miscommunication. Friend told me to consult the discord server where the owner was to join back, and oh boy was it HELL.\n\nFirstly, I quickly found out the owner used commands and cheats to find out where me (and my friend, whom hadn't cheated at all) were located, and whilst we were banned he leaked the coords and let the entire server destroy the bases we worked days on, along with our farms, animals, and villagers. All dead. My friend was devastated and I had to convince him to come back, which I will bring up later.\n\nNot only that, I was called trash and basically spat on by almost (key word ALMOST) the entire server. I was livid. Clearly it was just a miscommunication. I was told there were no rules and then got banned for breaking rules I was never told about. I'd get it if I wasn't told anything about rules, it's common sense, but I deliberately asked for this reason, and now I was being treated like a beggar, kneeling before self-narcissistic gods (that's what it felt like, at least...)\n\nNow, there was one dude, whom was kind, didn't assist in destroying the base, asked people to stop, and even gave us materials to get back on our feet. I thank him greatly for that.\n\nNow, onto my plan: I have located the base of nearly everyone, if not EVERYONE in the entire server, and me and my friend have worked our butts off to get enough lava, gunpowder, TNT, armor, ect., to destroy everyone's bases, the same way they did for ours, except the kind dude. I had him tell me his base, although I didn't tell him why, and he entrusted me to not destroy it. That is the only base I will protect. I have the coords, and my friend built a creeper farm for gunpowder. We have over 9 stacks of TNT so far, still growing by the day, and we will soon enact this plan.\n\nI also recruited people from discord to act out this plan with me, people like you who can help. The little things count. I am not going to advertise the server in my post though.\n\nWe don't have a date yet, but it's coming very soon, possibly this weekend. We are also going to get the dragon egg so they can never have it in the server ever again, so that's going to be nice. We intend on not joining the server after it's over, so we can really just get the last laugh, if we don't get banned afterwards anyways.

I cooked, you can clean it.\u201d Sorry WHAT?? Immediate argument. I refused to eat his dinner that he made for us a couple nights ago because he cut raw chicken on a cutting board, rinsed it with water, and then used same cutting board to cut produce and he got upset with me for not eating it! I can go on and on with this list because he will never listen to anything that I say or change anything that he does because it\u2019s \u201cnot how he was taught.\u201d He NEVER acted like this prior to us moving in together. He would constantly COMPLAIN that his prior roommates didn\u2019t clean and that he needed to do everything. Another thing is his maturity - he has none.

Running was not an option anymore, but in a month I was ready to go back to the gym without issues, and since I went using my bike and the gym is pretty far I was able to do 8 kms of biking three times per week just to get there, and I could still do some proper biking, so cardio was still on the table.\nThen my right ankle got tendinitis. I remember going for a long bike ride to my parent's town, 70-80 km from my city, something I had done other times without any issue, and having to stop midway and take a train because the pain got so bad I could barely walk. \nDespite everything 2024 was the year where I reached my best phisique ever. I could still climb, I could still bike to the gym, my knee wouldn't give me any problem in short biking distances or during climbing sessions, it only hurts when I sit down an my legs are at bent at that angle. \nThen, in August, in a period where I wasn't doing any activity because I was doing 10 hours shifts, my left shoulder decided she wanted to ruin my life too. Another tendinitis. My medic said both my shoulder and my knee needed rest. I've been doing jack shit for 4 months and they still hurt. Gave 220 euros to a physiatrist.

I\u2018ve lived in the group home for almost 2 years and my relationship with the 2 adults kind of responsible for us (they give us our money, help us with government stuff and other stuff) has gone down the drain. But it\u2018s not only me who has a personal problem with them it\u2019s literally all 6 of us girls. I\u2019m serious these 2 are unbelievably toxic. One of the is being toxic on purpose which she doesn\u2019t even try to hide. She refrained on being disgusting with me because i didn\u2019t really interact often with her since I saw how she treated some roommates who have already moved out. \n\nThe other one is literally one of the most unintelligent person I\u2019ve ever met. I don\u2019t just mean dumb I actually mean unintelligent. For her expecting her to be capable of multitasking is asking for too much und she literally behave as if it was insulting to expect that from her which is utterly ridiculous. Like it\u2019s fine if you can\u2019t do multitasking but just be honest and open about it instead of being defensive and acting like it\u2019s an insult. When you tell her something you know she is not going to remember it in 30 minutes. She thinks she is some type of super smart person who can read people easily while literally everyone else thinks she is the dumbest person to ever work with youths. My friends always ask me how these two got their jobs and I have no idea. She wanted me to throw my trash away and I had to tell her 3 times that I\u2019m taking it with me when I leave. Like this is not information that\u2019s hard to memorize. Bffr why do I have to tell her that 3 times in a timespan of literally 15 seconds. I wasn\u2019t home for two weeks because I visited my family for the holidays and it also wasn\u2019t trash that starts to smell or something it was some empty juice cartons and some leaflets about sales from a supermarket. \n\nI hate unintelligent people so much. Another problem is that she is really rude and I think kinda misogynistic towards another roommate, who\u2019s 16 and yeah that\u2019s not much younger than I am but I feels like she is being disrespectful to a young kid (because she is kinda immature it not in a bad way). This girl had it rough. Her mom died when she was a few years old then her father got sick and died around 3/4 years ago then her foster mom is kinda abusive and doesn\u2019t give a access to money or let her take a bath (wtf). She gets panic attacks when you scream at her because her father used to do that when she was younger. The unintelligent chick yelled at her one time which a could hear meters away even with 2 doors closed. After that the girl told me that she told the dumbie that she gets panic attacks when yell at and that she should talk in a friendlier tone and that there is no need to be rude. That bitch literally said she doesn\u2019t give a fuck and she had to deal with it. I\u2019d love to say I can\u2019t believe it but I do. There is literally nothing any one of us can do about these two. The only solace we have is each other. The two also noticed that noone likes them anymore now they want almost everyone to move out. No one can do anything about it cause it\u2019s their decision. \n\nIn the end I will just have to power through this time. And try to be there for my roommates because even if they treat all of us like trash they know I\u2019m not here for that bullshit which is why they want me out. \nIt\u2019s good to let all of this out to strangers. \nHave a great day\ud83d\ude4f", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Israel and Gaza are currently at war, making it a death trap to go there. Ukraine and Russia are also currently at war, making it a death trap to go there as well.\n\nAfrica has 54 countries, and while some of them are doing well, many of them are not, with high poverty rates.

There are tons of gang violence and rapes, and people are raping others. Some people will literally kidnap your baby, sacrifice your baby for some politicians up top, and then tell you your baby died of stillbirth. They'll put your baby up for adoption without your consent.\n\n Some of these people even kill their own babies because they are discriminating against them due to disabilities.

You can't even work as a maid there because they treat their maids terribly.\n\nSome South American countries are extremely dangerous. Venezuela is one of the most dangerous countries for women because of the gang violence. \n\nBack then American white people could just have dreams of traveling the world and then go to the most popular places, try to go to the greatest places all over, but it's not some super fun ride anymore.\n\nChristians & Jews can't tour Israel anymore, Muslims when even going back to their home country sometimes have issues because of the conflict going on in their country. \n\nSome people in the countries of Arabs are so against Western lifestyles that they will kill their daughters because they are living one. \n\nRape & Violence against women is an issue because they devalue women, and in India they sometimes drown babies in milk because they're girls. \n\nLike, imagine going up to India, falling in love with an Indian dude, taking him home with you, and marrying him only for him to try and kill your baby because you just so happen to have a little girl because of the culture shock -- because when you go to another country, you're going to have a culture shock.\n\nThe evil has become an evil place,  ut these countries were extremely evil. \n\nAt one point, even America wasn't really that great. It was a dystopia for black people and pretty much anyone that wasn't Caucasian. Anyone traveling here just to go all over the world would have pretty much suffered or not been allowed because they didn't want non-whites here. You could even experience xenophobia as a European.\n\nAn African person traveling here just for fun could have literally been lynched if they went to the wrong City around the wrong people. \n\nModern day, that's not the case, but other countries still have problems. China, in 2022\u20132023, just took down their one-child policy, which allows them to have as many children as they want without a fine. That was so late in the game!\n\nThey should have already had that, but America actually got scared that Asians were growing too much in population and were worried about what would happen if they were to war with us Americans due to how many Asians there were. They actually convinced China to instill a one-child law. They also got Korea to convince their population to abort for \"the betterment of society.\"\n\nIt was wild. They started the term \"overpopulation\" because of that.\n\nTraveling, especially with foreign diseases and COVID-19, is not safe. Africa has AIDS and Ebola, and tourists sometimes end up accidentally contributing to sex trafficking in Spain. Some of the biggest places where they go to get sex from prostitutes are actually places that kidnap and sex-traffic women. These women are ignored because they are mistakenly seen as just prostitutes instead of rape victims in Spain, only because people have no idea they are being trafficked.\n\nI just feel like hating your child because you couldn't travel the world is no longer a valid reason to hate them at this point. Hamas literally even attacked people who weren't even Israeli alongside Israeli in Israel. There were people who had only been to the festival in Israel during October 7th solely because they were traveling there during college and decided to go for fun only to be kidnapped as a hostage.\n\nTravelling isn't as safe as it was before because they don't care about the tourists! They don't even like the tourists. They'll screw you over regardless.\n\nThere are cases in Arabian countries where women have literally been stoned for rape just because they wore a shirt that showed shoulders. Just an average American shirt. Traveling to certain countries is dangerous and traveling all over the world is just putting yourself at risk multiple times depending on where you go. Abusing and resenting your kids is not the answer, it probably saved you if this was the only issue you had since people in other countries are just wilding. There are CIVIL WARS going on that we aren't having.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I have wondered if i had ADHD, autism etc, but i have never been diagnosed but i am looking into getting diagnosed. I have spent so much time on video games movies tv shows etc, i used to be able to focus and then use these things as \"fun\" but at the end of the day it means nothing. Every moment of joy i have ever had has been fleeting, and i have just spent so much time chasing dopamine. honestly though it kept me around though, back in the day when i was weak i needed whatever i could. I thought there was more to life then just studying. But there isnt, at least not really. I have always struggled socially, Its hard really, i say and do what i can and i always have been a little off. I missed the \"critical period\" of development, when i was young i was mute during those years.... So that messed me up lol.\n\nI wish i could have been \"normal\" but in some ways i wonder if i did this to myself, if my own mind was what did me in. I always wondered what was wrong with me etc.... But i digress i am emotional and i do what i can. Nobody is perfect and i am trying to survive.\n\nI have always looked for other things for joy, things besides work, but that is not really reasonable...\n\nIt doesnt matter if i am happy or not.\n\nSo i am going to sell my video game systems and not replace my hobbies with anything else, currently I am also doing some miniature painting but eh, i dont really like it that much. It does give me some joy to complete something though.\n\n It doesnt matter the result only the effort.\n\nI guess what i am saying is; my plan is to keep doing good in my life. Things that disrupt my schedule and routine are always tough. I will eat my healthy easy meals, I will learn to make things one thing at a time and i will spent more time with myself. Not looking for the internet to waste my time.\n\nI have wasted so much time, I have no skills and barely can function socially and workplace. I have done alright because i just say \"i will do what i can and thats alright\" and at the end of the day that is all anyone ever can do. I live in fear every day of everything. I am in constant fear and so i try to be strong in face of that fear. and sometimes that fear turns to apathy.\n\nSo i have a job, i have a savings, i know what i am doing at work, And honestly life is alright. part of me wants to own a condo but i am scared of changes and its alot to think of. honestly i feel like my mental devlopment is a bit off and i am kinda bad at life. I am really good at obsessing over like a couple things and studying but my brain just wants to obsess over things. So Today i will not watch youtube at all. I will not do anything.\n\nIf i had all the money in the world, and was omnipotent, I would want to be in an empty room, eating 3 meals a day of something simple like eggs for breakfast, lunch of chicken breast and salad, and dinner of idk maybe some sardines or something. \n\nThe world scares me with its complexity so i try to simplify it but sometimes in simplifying it it makes things worse.

At this time the rich are getting richer while those of us who live paycheck to paycheck or barely above are struggling to survive. Our loved ones who are sick are dying. People can't afford to have decent living conditions, let alone children. Some human beings, funny most, if not all are men, are hoarding massive amounts of wealth and our government is complacent - no not complacent aggressively trying to ensure this remains the status quo so they can be bought for pennies on the dollar. Government and Military at the higher levels seem to be mostly dominated by men. billions of our tax dollars can go the war machine and military complex funding instruments of death, but an American no fuck that a human being in medical need can't get what they need to live. I just don't understand it. In my personal work environment I have had both men and women as my director, there was and continue to be many directors as are feild is rapidly expanding. In my opinion I much more enjoyed working for women. I'm not saying all men in the director position were bad, however if I look at them both as a whole I found women to be far more competent and compassionate. Maybe it's time for women to get a crack at dealing with our collective crazy asses world wide. At this point I'm dying for change and I much rather would want caring, compassion and competency. I'm a straight man veteran, I just want affordable housing ending homelessness, aggressively combating all illness, healthcare for all, you know basic human rights for all and i mean all!!

Here\u2019s an example.\n\nA little while back my sister was driving us to school (I would\u2019ve drove but both my sisters vetoed it) and was speeding down a hill. I told her to slow down cause she was going 40mph down a hill but she said \u201cI know how to drive! Stop mansplaining it to me!\u201d Ok first off, what? How is it mansplaining when I\u2019m telling her to stop breaking the speed limit and being a reckless driver? \n\nAnother time was when I was waiting to use the microwave to warm up some food. My sister, same one that was driving, was microwaving soup. You\u2019d think she\u2019d not be able to get it wrong but NO! She left a spoon in the microwave. Something everyone should know, NEVER PUT METAL IN THE MICROWAVE!! That\u2019s the kind of stupid even a complete moron could figure out. Fortunately the microwave didn\u2019t explode. I calmly told her that putting metal in the microwave is dangerous and it could\u2019ve exploded. But then she shouted at me and told me to stop mansplaining. Like what the hell?! \n \n\nIs there a woman term for mansplaining? Is it \u201cwomansplaining\u201d? \u201cGirlsplaining\u201d? I\u2019m sick of being told that I\u2019m \u201cmansplaining\u201d when my sister is being an idiot. I find it rude that when I\u2019m calmly telling my sister not to do something dangerous she shouts at me, calls me names, and says I\u2019m \u201cmansplaining\u201d everything to her when I\u2019m not! If she gets in a car crash for being reckless, fine with me, but I don\u2019t want to be in the car with her! And let me make something clear.

Just because you don\u2019t have a dick, doesn\u2019t mean you get to be one. When a man corrects you for doing something wrong, or perhaps completely stupid, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re \u201cmansplaining\u201d.

And won't have my staff dismiss patients because they're pressed for time and aren't able to see all patients in timely manner. There's something seriously wrong with the world where people put more priority on profits, over bettering lives of people (saving people) and doing a right thing. The fact that so many people accept understaffing in hospitals, which then forces staff to work long hours, is so bizarre, as if it's completely normal instead of questioning why hospitals are constantly chronically understaffed. Also, why can't they afford adequate breaks to ER staff? Why are nurses talking about how they haven't eaten in 12 hours? It literally takes 5-10 minutes to eat a sandwich. Why don't the higher-ups prioritize their staff receiving adequate, timely food so that they have the energy needed to work their jobs? What is it with history of our countries forcing people in ER rescue positions be burned out and sleep deprived? They do this to paramedics too. It's incredibly dangerous to have firefighters, paramedics, etc be sleep deprived while driving a vehicle at high speeds. \n\n\n(Not an actual employee at any of those facilities.

Did my insurance just conveniently disappear the moment I had to file a claim? How is it physically possible to file a claim and pay a deductible for insurance you don't have? So I have to call the third party insurance company and have them manually approve the claim. But now the shipment of my phone has been delayed, they don't ship through the weekends, and what's to be the worst snow storm of the last 10 years in my area is coming. They tell me for any further issues I need to go to my service provider again. So I go back to them the following day, explain to them what happened, to which they say \"yeah sorry, we can only sell you a new phone.\" It is my only option as my wife and son are currently 4 hours away and I refuse to not be in contact with them, but as it's the first of the month and we've just paid rent, a car note, and bought groceries, i'm not in the position to be buying a new phone. That's the whole god damn reason I have insurance. So I tell them I'll have to come back tomorrow. \n\n  \nNow it's today. I had to swallow my pride and ask my parents for money to buy this phone, but when I go back to the store they tell me they can just factor the cost in to my monthly bill. HALLELUJAH. I'm getting somewhere and I won't have to pay an arm and a leg! They grab the phone and go to activate it and ACTUALLY NO FUCK YOU JUST KIDDING!!!!!!! \"You pay your bill twice a month, that's technically a payment arrangement, which means you have an outstanding balance with us and you have to pay up front for the phone.\" We have paid our phone bill this way for the last four years, since we opened this phone plan, and it has never been an issue for anything at all. We've done upgrades. We've filed an insurance claim in the past. NONE OF THIS MATTERED. But they don't care, and just tell me that i'm fucked.

During my school days and also in kindergarten I had many years of experiences with bullying and exclusion which still shapes me today and has a great influence on me as a person. I am very withdrawn and avoid unnecessary conversations and any kind of contact. I don't have any friends or other private contacts other than my family. My hobbies are fitness and running. To get back to the topic I experienced a lot of violence and bullying from other children during my elementary school years so I was happy to be able to move on to a high school after the 4th grade because I thought that I could finally get away from this crypt and that I could escape those people but of course I was wrong. The next few years were also full of bullying, exclusion and torment from day one. It felt like that I was always the chosen one to be the victim. I was already very quiet and a bit chubby back then so I was an easy target but I just don't see how that could be the reason for it I mean I have never done anything to them? After the 8th grade we were mixed with our parallel class. For the most part we all knew each other. Afterwards I finally had people with whom I could spend the breaks and have a chat in between. This also stopped the bullying from the others. But the relationship was still toxic. I was repeatedly put down, yelled at and often not invited to private meetings especially in my final year of 12th grade. That's when I realized that these people weren't my friends but that my presence had just been tolerated up to that point. In the last 6 months of school I've decided to distance myself to see if they'll even notice and contact me on their own but as I thought none of them have contacted me or even tried to to pass by my classroom I mean we were in the same building and not even far from each other. Then school ended and I haven't had any contact with those people since then. When I still had Insta I have \"stalked\" some of them every now and then to see what was going on with their lives but I have since deleted my Insta. I was just surprised that absolutely none of them contacted me. During my vocational school I saw someone who was also friends with the same people and I knew him from the past. He told me \"everyone misses you\" but I didn't ask any further questions because I just wanted to get away from his presence at that moment. That was a few years ago now and to this day I still ask myself whom he meant and if that was really true why haven't I heard from them? I feel lonely, worthless and forgotten. Every now and then I see them in my dreams especially tonight it was actually very intense which is why I'm writing this post here. It feels like everyone has moved on with that time of their life and with me and here I am at 25 still hanging on to the past. I just don't know what to do and I feel very desperate.

The creator is known to love AI and everyone's ignoring the AI vibe it has around it as well as the fact I can list pals and what Pokemon they were ripped off. Every. Single. Pal. It was MADE to target the whiners that didn't have a video game where they felt they could be mindlessly VOILENT to something sentient but not human. And let's not even go into the fact you basically enslave pals instead of being friends more like Pokemon. It attracted all the people they wanted it to.\n\n The toxic people, complainers, and generally weird people who got booted from most games because of icky behaviour,  people who oversexualize animal characters, basically all the basement dwellers and gave them something they were told they wanted. All so they could get their money. After the lawsuits and then new consoles dropping after a few months (I suspect soon) palworld is gonna be forgotten and then the same people playing it and defending it are gonna be crashing out about how it's a terrible game. We see it happen alot with copycat games like this. \n\nI could make an entire 3 hour video about the red flags in the company alone, BEFORE even starting on why palworld is a red flag. At this point the copycat games have now been shown they can do better than title brands and these weirdo defenders have now allowed them to do so on a bigger level. And he's so nonchalant when it comes to art theft/AI and using other companies/people's designs and ideas without paying or crediting. (Not to mention an artist of palworld boasted about copying half her designs from something and the posts magically disappeared when rumors of a lawsuit came about)\n\nWhen we see more unoriginal games, and can't find anything new to play we can blame palworld. Them entering the game industry with palworld and whatever half compartmentalized AI they used to help make it is gonna make other companies do the same. And nobody. Seems. To see it. I mean seriously we've always tried to avoid games like this for that reason, to avoid more so less, copycat money grabs that we know won't do good for more than a year or two. The creator should've just kept it as an idea, because when it fails just like the rest of his games I hope we never let him forget it. \n\n(Edited to make easier to read and fix some typos I'm still sleep deprived so it's not 100%)", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I respected their decision but deep inside I was genuinely getting frustrated. We spoiled about what would happen with our OCs in their stories, so why would this be any different?

I wish I could be in Britain or Europe or some shit. I could get medical help or give birth without selling my soul for it. This is a laughing stock country. I just want peace and tranquility. The grass is always greener but this is getting ridiculous. Every day we're groomed into being more accustomed to bullshit being forced on us.

Had a co worker cause a solid hour long ruckus because she refused to sell beer to literally like someone old enough to be my grandma. Tf is wrong with you lol. Same with the theatres like I had a kid deny me with a picture of my license at 20 years old. Like buddy you do realize I can pirate this movie on my phone right now or literally just look up actual porn or death videos like how ab you use your head. \n\nExample 2: The gym worker who meticulously watched us until I left to kick my ex out of the gym because I was the pass holder and she was my guest and I technically have to be there. So many annoying things with this. Like 1 the majority of you are buried in your laptop with schoolwork you do not need to be doing this. And literally if I sit in the corner and stare at the wall my ex is good to workout np but the second I leave the building it\u2019s a problem? Like can I be right outside the door? In my car? Is this causing you to lose profit? Will you somehow get in trouble for not catching her? (Hell no) like the fact you sat around and waited for me to leave then go into the locker room and kick her out in front of people is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nExample 3: went to Tim Hortons and had a $1 coffee coupon. Proceeded to pay 2$ on my card when they tell me it\u2019s another dollar. \u201cOops, here\u2019s this coupon.\u201d \u201cOh you actually have to finish paying for this one before you can use that now.\u201d Oh really?

I have worked like 4 different fast food jobs i know FOR A FACT you can cancel the order, refund me, comp it, get the manager, any known number of solutions in fact you actually owe me money. Honestly just stupid people. \n\nHard to think of another rn but you know what I mean. Another small example kinda is a guy I saw outside the gym leave and then look at me and go back and make sure the door shut behind him. (You have to scan your badge to get in) like my guy the place is empty. If I workout for free it doesn\u2019t affect anyone else working out, any worker, or you in any way.

It contains how long it takes to walk regular routes.\nYes you can use google maps to get the time, and I often do. \nBut I walk much quicker than the average person, there are certain paths not logged on goggle maps and I can\u2019t rely on mobile data. \nIt\u2019s divided into sections.\nSchool, shops, transport etc.\nHome to station: 25-30 minutes\nHome to highstreet: 30-40 minutes \nAnd so on.\n\nI quite like walking so I don\u2019t mind longer journeys when my health allows for them.\nBut public transport is worse.\nTrains aren\u2019t as bad due to how they function.\nCars are okay as you can use satnav \nBut buses, with the amount of delays and stops. \nThere\u2019s no way for me to time the journey as it changes so heavily \n\nI know almost everyone has experienced time running away with itself.\nThe saying \u201ctime flies when your having fun\u201d exists for a reason \nI know there that whole thing that time feels like it goes quicker when your enjoying yourself and slower when your bored.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t an occasional experience.\nIt\u2019s every day of my life.\nIt\u2019s not that I feel time goes quickly or slowly.\nIt\u2019s that I don\u2019t feel it at all.\n\nI look at my clock\n14:00. A while later I look at it again. 14:04. Okay 4 minutes has passed, that\u2019s what 4 minutes feels like. So I\u2019ll try and look at it again when I feel another 4 minutes have passed. So 14:08. \nI look at my clock again 14:47. \n\nI cannot estimate how long a task will take me.\n\nLinear tasks that are similar every time, I time them. Then I know.\nLike showers. \nBasic shower, shower and hair wash, shower hair wash and shave etc. \n\nWhen I do these tasks I set four alarms. \nLet\u2019s say a task takes 20 minutes.\nI\u2019ll set \n1/4 5 minutes \n2/4 10 minutes \n3/4 15 minutes \n4/4 20 minutes \nThis helps keep me on track. If I don\u2019t keep myself on track then I\u2019ll take longer and I have no idea how much longer.\n\nLet\u2019s say I get in the shower, to clean and wash my hair. No alarms. I do what I need, get out, dry off, leave. \n\nI know how long it takes based on my timed speed.\nBut without the alarms keeping me on track it could have taken me 3x longer.\nI have no idea why, no idea what happens, where that time goes.  \n\nBut tasks that differ, like cleaning my room. It depends on how much there is to clean.\nI can\u2019t look at my room and tell you how long it will take to clean.\n\nIt could take an hour or three. I have no way of understanding it.\n\nSchool work is the worst.\nI accepted a long time ago that work like that will take me longer than it takes most.\nAs I have dyslexic and ADHD worded information takes me longer to process and I\u2019m easily distracted.\n\nBut how much longer, or how long it should take a typical person. \nI have no idea.\nLet\u2019s say I have 10 exam questions to do. I have no way of understanding how long it might take me.\n\nCoursework is the hardest. \nI\u2019ve never done particularly well at exams especially because of my ADHD and dyslexia so I\u2019m more suited to coursework.\nBut coursework has no end. I can go off on tangents and write way too much making it take far longer than it should. \nAdd the fact I have no concept of time, I often run out of time. \n\nI\u2019ve learnt to use other tools not just alarms as they aren\u2019t always practical.\n\nI can roughly estimate the time based on the sun, but in the darkest of winter and brightest of summer it\u2019s much harder.\nI can use TV shows, knowing how long an episode is to understand how much time has passed. \n\nMy time blindness isn\u2019t caused by bad time management. \n\nMy time blindness is caused by me having no practical concept of time which causes bad time management.\n\nIt\u2019s not laziness or an excuse.\nI\u2019ve tried and tired my whole life to gain a practical concept of time.\n\nI\u2019d sit and try to do something for X amount of time. \nTo try and learn what time felt like.\nI\u2019d sit down and plan to colour for 15 minutes. I\u2019d start with alarms so I got a sense of what 15 minutes feels like, then try without alarms.\n\nI\u2019d get my parents to test me. Randomly ask how long it\u2019s been since *blank*. \n\nNothing worked. \n\nYes I\u2019m late, I don\u2019t complete tasks on time, I run out of time to do things.\nAnd yes this is annoying for other people.\n\nBut I am only part of your life. \nThis is my life, my whole life. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t annoying nor am I saying I deserve unreasonable accommodation. \n\nBut I don\u2019t mean to do it.

Because those in the know, mainly the Indian Consulate and other travelers online with this experience, refused to answer or never got around to answering my question. I'd called the Consulate for over a week--just to be sure before applying--leaving 3 messages that were never returned. \"Your call will be returned over the next business day\". (Yes, I'm aware of the holiday season. People don't need visas during the holidays?) Posts I made either got ignored or received some unsolicited advice about...not the question. (The replies are always everything else BUT an answer to the actual question asked.)\n\nAs I understood it, before meeting someone in person, the e-Visa (applied for online quickly) and Tourist Visa (initiated online, finalized in person) allows for air+sea access and full access, respectfully. Wrong. The access is the same. I only learned this at the visa appointment.\n\nThe agent said to cross the border by land, I would have had to apply for that at the Indian Consulate in that adjacent country before the crossing. She said that I should have asked the Indian Consulate in NY. As I've said, I never got an answer. ((Oh ALSO there was a chatbot on their website that led me to submit my question, and everytime I did, it booted me out when submitting my question. Whether by mobile or desktop.)) I also, don't understand why when initiating my application for this visa online why I had to go to a VFS office in the same city as the Consulate. They're within a mile of each other. If I'm going to spend 70USD on a round trip ticket and 60USD for the appointment itself, I might as well have an appointment at the Consulate.\n\nI'll now compare apples to oranges. I didn't have such a complication when applying for my Chinese visa. There was an agent in Chinatown, Philadelphia. Applied for the visa on the spot and they mailed it to me. She answered all of my questions and had me adjust my application as needed. One fee. On the spot. Simple and affordable.\n\nA bit of a rant, all of this. Yes. Because the confusion is unnecessary. Websites, forums, chat bots, phone numbers and emails and you don't get the correct information until you're in another state and 400USD lighter. \"Oh, you shoulda...\" after the fact. Why not answer when asked if you knew all along? Not to the visa agent. She was very sweet and helpful. All the employees working in the Indian Visa office were very courteous, professional and efficient. The one pleasant aspect of this debacle.\n\nSo, my itinerary has to be slightly adjusted; I wasted money and a day. I have heard and believe that the ride out of Nepal by bus and across Sikkim can be pretty rough but that's what I wanted to do. That's my business.

I'm genuinely not trying to humblebrag in this post though- I miss plenty of stuff too. \n\nI just want to vent a frustration/confusion I have regarding people who claim I'm noticing \"tiny details\" when in reality they just have lower media comprehension. As in, they need things to be shown more obviously or spelled out more clearly in order to catch them. Which, to someone like me, would ruin the experience since subtlety is a powerful storytelling tool and often creates greater emotional impact. Subtle cues allow the viewer to connect the dots in their own mind, leading them to actually feel the message, rather than simply observing the message on a screen or a page. \n\nNow I want to make it clear that this is not a dig at neurodivergent/autistic people. I myself am autistic. I miss social cues in other ways, generally in real life rather than when consuming media. I'm generally a highly perceptive person so I pick up on hints and patterns and clues in things like movies and TV. Good writing, acting, directing, cinematography, etc. REALLY matters to me and I appreciate when it's done well. Storytelling is an art and I treat/consume it as such. \n\nI just get so CONFUSED and often frustrated when someone doesn't get something, or gets impressed by something so small and/or obvious, because it's like we're existing on different planes.

Yeah I saw that in the movie. I noticed when it happened. It was cool. I'm just not excited or impressed because it was.... kinda obvious to me? And not that surprising or striking? It wasn't even an easter egg, just... a choice. A good one but still. Not an EVENT I needed a tiktok to tell me about afterwards. \n\nI don't say all that to the person obviously. I know that might be dickish. But my lack of enthusiasm bums them out and makes THEM feel like I don't get it. But I DO get it. It's just not NEW to me. I actually saw it first and I assumed you did too, when it happened on screen. \n\n\"Omg look at this Easter egg in the movie, when she sings about what she wants, it shows what she wants on screen for a moment\" [me, unimpressed because that was extremely obvious and expected] \"well I guess you do tend to notice small details like that\"\n\nNO! Do not give in to helplessness! You are capable of being literate! Media comprehension is not a superpower I was born with! I am not some demigod with magic psychic detail-oriented movie-watching powers just because I can SEE and INTERPRET what the movie is showing me! \n\nIt just feels like a weird form of anti-intellectualism.

Lots of smal gifts, flowers, cute notes, touching me a lot, the intimacy was great, he was giving me lots of compliments always, etc. Though the more the relationship went on and the less he started demonstrating love.\n\n6months-ish into the relationship, we had a big fight regarding boundaries and trust. The relationship almost ended there but he suggested couple therapy and check ups every week. The fact that he suggested that really made me realize that he was really serious about us.\n...\nBut then nothing happened. \nI was the one initiating the check ups everytime, and he never booked anything for the therapist, even if we found one. I felt let down and told him that. He said sorry and that he would make an effort to do it.\n... but then he didn't \n\nWe're ~6months after that and clearly I'm carrying wounds from that. Not only the initial event hurt me badly, but the lack of action broke me again and again. I admit, these wounds would sometimes show in my attitude. Things that would normally not bother me (or not enough to mention them) would now irritate me.\n\nThen he moved in with me. I tought it would help because texting can be challenging when there's something going on. \n\nBut we still have fights and try to find ways to communicate better and to heal those wounds, he suggests check ups again but different format.\n...But then he's not doing them.\n\nWe're not intimate anymore. It happened once in the couple past months. He goes to bed 3-4hours after me and wakes up 3 hours after me. I feel like it doesn't help us feeling closer because we live on different schedule. We agreed to wake up at an hour that would fit us both, but then when it rings he doesn't get up and he ends up getting out of bed the same time he normally would.\n\nIn the morning, he doesn't talk much. He doesn't really react to my kisses and hugs because he says he's not a morning person. Before, he would wake up and go on his phone and I said I would like to have a good morning and some time together to wake up and feel all lovey-dovey (and get closer potentially) so he stopped doing that. \n\nThough today, we were cooking breakfast and I barealy talked because we were watching twitch, but I was still talking a little bit and he said he's not a morning person and needs to wake up... we were awake for 2.5 hours at this point and I was like huh??? I felt kind of rejected and he said he needed space like that sometimes. \n\nHe said he's stressed and that our fights affect our intimacy, but our fights are mostly happening because he's just changing before my eyes, becoming a cold boyfriend and I tell him I'm not happy. When I bring those points, he's saying that kissing me and giving my hugs and spending time together IT'S being a not-cold-boyfriend. \n\nHe's very frustrated with me not trusting him but he broke my trust by the event that happened and then not holding up to his words many, many times. He says that I don't listen to his side and he doesn't feel heard.\n\nAfter all of this though, he's saying that we should stay together and he sees a future with me. We both want that but I feel like he just doesn't have the motivation at all to make the actual work it needs to make it work. I'm sad and I told him that but the message just doesn't seem to go through.\n\nI'm sad chat \ud83d\ude14\u270c\ufe0f\n", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I hate those wretched, evil *things* that somehow find their way in every part of my life. Those despicable, abhorrent and detestable demons that corrupt everything I hold dear.\n\nNow, hating a fruit or vegetable is nothing new. Almost everybody dislikes something, and it's difficult to avoid it, and even if you eat it it's not the end of the world.\n\nNot with tomatoes.\n\nPerhaps this might be difficult to understand for someone with normal tastes. What's so difficult about hating tomatoes specifically? You just don't eat them right?\n\nWell, the issue lies in the fact that LITERALLY EVERY GOD DAMN FOOD HAS THEM. \n\nI go out to eat with friends. Order pizza. Tomatoes.\n\nWell, that's ok, just order burgers or something.\n\nNope, they have tomatoes.\n\nWell, surely a salad can't have them right?\n\nLike 80% of them have tomatoes, which makes sense because they are one of the healthiest fruits. Or vegetable, whatever, I dont fuckin care\n\nThese are only a few examples, but you get my point. They are *everywhere*. No matter where you look, you can not avoid them.\n\nOk, so like, just remove them. What's the big deal?\n\nThe problem is that I don't even wanna touch those damn fiends. Hell, even *looking* at them makes me wanna puke. Of course I don't want my hands anywhere near them.\n\nAlright, order the food without tomatoes. That can fix it.\n\nUnfortunately for me, what this option accomplishes most of the time is the waiter always fogetting to say this one important itty-bitty piece of information to the chef. So most of the time I have to go up to the chef myself and relay this crucial info.\n\nHowever sometimes I don't have the luxury of asking for no tomatoes, because they are added to food such as french fries in restaurants. And that is not written anywhere. In that scenario I'm forced to ask either my parents or friends to eat the tomatoes. Great, problem solved, right?\n\nWRONG!\n\nBecause tomatoes are not like other food where you can just take it and eat it without any consequences. You see, when you take the tomato, oftentimes it leaves it's little disgusting cum juice wherever it lay. And try as I might I *can't* remove it. If it's off to the side in my plate that's my fine, I can just avoid it. However, if it's in my god damn d\u00f6ner even if I remove the tomatoes the juice is still there and I can not fuckin do anything. It's infuriating\n\nBut that is not all.\n\nOh, we haven't even gotten started.\n\nWhenever I meet someone new and we go out to eat or something like that, oftentimes I will encounter the tomatoes and I will have to avoid them. Naturally, my interlocutor would ask if I don't like tomatoes, to which I of course answer that I fuckin despite them. This usually leads to 'WHAAAAAAT? YOU DON'T LIKE *TOMATOES*? BUT WHY NOT?' as if it's something fuckin weird and unheard of. What is your deal? I don't see that kinda reaction when someone says they don't like pickles. But them moment I say I don't like tomatoes I'm suddenly seen as some kinda weirdo and outsider?\n\nWhat is this discrimination?\n\nWhat have I done to deserve this?\n\nDo people not realize I didn't *want* to be like this? Of course I would've preferred to like tomatoes if I could, it's only caused me problems.\n\nI feel abandoned, rejected.\n\nTo some it might only be a small thing, but it is those small things in life that truely matter.\n\nI just wanna be understood, accepted. \n\nIs that really so much to ask for?\n\nI truly am the last sane person in an insane world.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

One of the things on the list was dog food. \n\nWe have a 9 year old dog who has been with me his whole life, since before I met my husband. My husband loves him dearly and treats him as such. Our dog, like many dogs, is highly allergic to chicken. I discovered this when he was a puppy, and have been adamant about only feeding him chicken free food. This has proven to be a bit of a challenge, because many dog food manufacturers sneak chicken fat or chicken meal into their recipes that are \u201clamb and rice\u201d or \u201cpork and rice\u201d or whatever. \n\nMoney has been kind of tight lately, so rather than my dog eating the food that I know is safe for him, we\u2019ve been checking all the food that\u2019s on sale first and we\u2019ve gotten lucky quite a few times. A few months ago we got a huge bag of food for half price, twice the size of his normal bag! But this evening\u2026 this evening my husband comes home with a 40 lb bag of Purina One Lamb and Rice, slices it open, feeds the dog and empties it into the food container. When he was done with the bag, I looked at the ingredients and chicken meal is the fourth ingredient listed. \n\nHe swears he looked, and I do believe him. We\u2019ve had to spend over an hour in the pet store multiple times just checking ingredients. But man am I mad. Any amount of chicken consumption makes my poor boys hair fall out in chunks, his ears and body are incredibly itchy constantly, he\u2019s just miserable. And here I am with nothing but a 40 lb bag of poison to give my dog to eat. I can\u2019t return the food since it\u2019s already been opened. It\u2019s going to take two months from his last consumption of this food before he\u2019s right again. \n\nI really wish dog food companies would put chicken, the most common allergen for dogs, on the front of the bag so it\u2019s clear for anyone who\u2019s going to purchase. Or have it listed in a box or something like they do on human food for peanuts and milk. \n\nI\u2019ve sent a complaint to Purina in regard to their poor packaging design, but I doubt they\u2019ll actually do anything about the situation. I just wish dog food manufacturers would do better for all the dogs out there who are allergic to chicken and make it easier for their owners to pick food out for them.

To start, you need to find people who are similar age, have similar interests, and live nearby. That in itself is difficult. However, once you've found people who fit that criteria (I've recently joined a lot of groups in my area), nobody wants to fucking hang out or do anything. \n\nI noticed this trend of antisocial behavior in college. I would ask people directly if they wanted to form a study group. 9/10 times I was turned down and was unable to form one - the times I was able to form one everyone in the group did amazingly on the final because of it. Low commitment (literally just wanted to meet once), almost strictly beneficial (studying with 4 other people won't fuck up the grade curve), and people were still unwilling to commit to it. In some classes I even failed in the creation of a group chat so we could all help each other with homework. Totally benign and again, beneficial without any commitment, and I got turned down. Friend groups in college were largely made in the first week of freshman year and every single attempt I made to change that was rebuffed.\n\nThis shit continues after college. I've found some groups in the area I live in that are for some of my interests. I recently posted in one, simply asking if anyone lived nearby and was interested in doing the activity the group was literally created for. It got 0 engagement. There was no requirement to commit, I was just looking for the potential to do it in the future.\n\nI try to place myself in other people's shoes with thoughts like \"I don't know if I can trust this person\". Except nobody else makes a fucking effort like I do so I can't relate. If someone who looked my age was posting asking for buddies to do something I'm interested in, I would reach out.\n\nCan anyone else relate to this shit?

Hm. So, you announce this game in 2020 and SIX years of a wait I have to go through. Um, excuse me, but what in God's name is going on over there? And now, with this recent pivot for the brand I don't even need the Xbox to play it. If I have to wait SIX years to play this game then I can certainly wait, what? Six and a half years? Seven tops? Or maybe by then it'll be day and date on Playstation. You know, this leads to another fine point. Remember this; \"This is about bringing high quality exclusive content to (xbox gamers)\"? Ho hum. Indeed. So, was that a lie? What about this one; \"are either of those games Indiana Jones or Starfield?\" \"No.\" Oh, really? well it was only a few months before the first part of that statement was a lie and now a few months later the whole thing was a lie. So, Phil, if you're reading this; why should I believe anything people at Xbox are telling me? I bought into the Xbox this gen because I believed in Phil's vision for Xbox. I saw him turn around the One and knew - or thought I knew - he could bring Xbox back from the brink. The plan was solid. Buying these studios was supposed to bring all sorts of high quality games to Xbox, but now the plan seems to be nothing more than becoming a mega publisher. Now, this isn't about gate keeping. I couldn't care one wit about sharing games with other platforms, in theory, but the issue is that in this industry a hardware platform can not survive without exclusives. I understand it's a business and at the end of the day profit is what counts. Okay. Well, you know what Phil? You made PROMISES to your players that this was about improving Xbox and making US happy. Where is all that now? So, ultimately, my question is this; why did I buy an Xbox? Why did I stick with this brand against Playstation? Playstation has all their games and now that'll include Xbox's. What is the point of this investment? Why did I make this decision? The biggest slap in the face here is in the future of this brand. I'm sorry, but it's true that a platform lives on the strength of its exclusives. It doesn't matter that the Xbox is more powerful or a better platform as far as user friendliness and services. That's not enough to survive. So I am convinced that there MIGHT be ONE last hardware generation of Xbox before the CEO decides it's better to just publish. This, eventually, leads to the issue of the totality of our investments in software here. There is not going to be hardware going forward all the way. No, that's a lie. Just like the rest. So all the games we bought and all this backwards compatibility means nothing. Eventually it'll just be an app, no local computing, just servers that will never overcome the problem of latency. Why am I here? The one reason I'll buy Robocop today is because I can never afford, in the foreseeable future, a PS5. I'm stuck with a dying platform; which don't get me wrong, as a product I love it, but this is all for naught. In time, it's all for nothing.

Like with some of the stuff he's done, I refuse to believe he doesn't understand why it's wrong.  \n\nHe went out of his way to make himself my safe space. That I can vent and tell him everything. That he wants to help. Then when I do that, I'm too negative. I'm sorry I just failed uni and feel hopeless? It's not like you tell me things will get better and all of a sudden i don't feel horrible about my future. Mind you, he is studying psychology and wants to become a therapist. I think he has a saviour complex and resents me because he can't fix me. Whatever the issue is, i hope he stays far away from me and I never find out. I hope he gets his karma.

Hear me out.\n\nHumans. Humans more than any other type of creature I could name, regardless of the manner. Ever since the beginning of time, we've been fighting to stand at the top, not just to survive, not just to see another day, to win. Don't get me wrong, I am \\*fully\\* aware that \\*all\\* creatures could do this. I'd name who that did quite a job at making this clear if it wouldn't break a rule of this subreddit. From any animal you could name in the thickest jungles of Africa or the deepest trenches in the ocean, to the most civilized of being, us humans, in any tribe, village, town or city, to even mere \\*hamsters\\*, the same thing happens: Everyone gets an equal amount and equal access to resources, but some or someone out there decides they want it all for themselves to thrive off of the pain of everyone else struggling to get a piece. When you want it, you want it all for yourself, you won't give it up. Money, power, some kind of material, if you've got it, you won't let it go. It's like the Penguin says: If you want it, you'd like to think you've got it, and if you don't, you'll get it.\n\nHumans don't have poison to inject into their foes, sharp beaks or claws, and are practically a failure of evolution because we can't seem to run away from \\*anything\\*. Brown bears, in comparison, can go all over the place, so when one spots you, it's game over. Humans don't have any real form of self-defense, but they \\*do\\* have intelligence. The problem is, this intelligence tends to be used in quite evil ways.\n\nDon't believe me? Internet or not, when's the last time you went a day without hearing about a crime of some kind, someone being put away, or someone being mistreated and inescapably? I could name a subreddit that talks about how people have to deal with unpleasant family situations, and two where people cry in distress about social problems, their inability to and how they screwed it up with no way to fix it. I could, but again, subreddit rules.\n\nAt the same time, we are constantly being fed all of this junk about how people are doing great, fantastic, living lives of luxury, just to convince people that they're missing out, despite the fact that some of us can't even \\*afford\\* to. We're being fed desires of luxuries instead of looking into basic necessities. To this end, the internet used to be a place to \\*escape\\* from people in a way, but now, it's \\*staying off\\* that does the trick.\n\nAll of this raises a point that I've gone over someplace else out here regarding humans: They want only to win, for them to win requires someone to lose, they'd hate to lose but would \\*love\\* to see someone else lose instead, and if they can't win, they'll take someone down with them to satisfy themselves. The evil that is humanity has \\*so\\* many names that it's mind-boggling and, at the same time, as depressing as some of the subreddits I am about to leave to maybe \\*not\\* feel that way: Greed, selfishness, malice, hate, apathy, narcissism, hostility...\n\nFrom the beginning of time, when we were mare cavemen, all the way up to now, where we're wearing custom-made tailored suits, we're still finding ways to threaten, endanger, harm and even remove one another from the census. One could say this isn't the case everywhere, that if you look at places like Finland, for instance, people have it peaceful because of their wonderful education system, but I guarantee, if you web search any place on earth, any country, you'll find \\*something\\* bad about them. Racism isn't \\*always\\* the first or greatest of a country's or civilization's problems. \n\nDon't believe me? Finland has a loneliness epidemic that pushes people into alcoholism. Furthermore, marriages are only ceremonial; There's no real love happening out there in a country of 5-and-a-half million. Switzerland has no-go zones where they constrain Somalians. Once the police leave the scene, you'd better be right behind them. Don't believe me \\*there\\*? Ask 60 Minutes. South Africa is so financially imbalanced, they enact loadshedding: During certain times of the day, the entire country gets purposeful, scheduled power outages for hours on end. When you don't have a constant supply of power, things that need it either spoil or don't happen. At that point, why run a business down there? Even worse, someone tried to solve this with solar panels, but lo and behold, the politicians sued them and their customers to living hell until they were removed. I'd name the source, but this subreddit has other ideas.\n\nEverywhere you look, there are civil problems that, at the end of the day, didn't need to happen but simply did because someone wanted to take from someone else. If greed and selfishness are a part of human nature, then it doesn't matter \\*what\\* you do to change the events, how far back in time you go to change \\*what\\*, there will \\*still\\* be problems.\n\nI can't name what in particular, but I increasingly believe we're gonna need a \\*new\\* type of intelligent creature to take our place, a kind that isn't willing to participate in evil or play a long con just to sweep the rug out from everyone else's feet.\n\nYes, this is a conspiracy theory of some kind, and I know exactly how insane this makes me sound. I simply can't think of a better solution to this. Everything done to stem the evil of human behavior is always temporary: Without disincentives, people are going to act out their wildest dreams. Without a constant reward, people are going to relapse into the behavior they were punished for.\n\nI don't speak on a search for perfection, just an end to this nonsense.

But I don't like that my arms or chest muscles don't pop even just a little bit (when I'm not working out). \n\nI go to the gym because I want to be bigger obviously. Yes I'm not too skinny but when I'm not working out (which I wasn't up until a year ago) I don't like the thickness of my arms or my pecks being kind of small.\n\nWhat going to the gym for a year has done to me is BARELY get me to be kind of toned. And the only thing that happens is I get thicker arms, become satisfied for a little bit then shrink again and that just keeps happening again and again.\n\nWhats the point? I don't enjoy the process anyways i just want the results really badly.

New friends and coworkers and people who I met for the first time like after I've been to the gym for a year of working out who never seen me before I started working out can't tell necessarily that I workout. \n\nIn other words it's not obvious to people that I even go to the gym or lift weights.

I have a good body frame, and a nice physique I feel would look so good on me that jt just makes me so depressed I can't do the same. \n\nThe more depressing thing about stopping is that I won't even have that slight tone that I can have with working out which partially satisfies me since I feel my arms aren't too skinny, something that really bothers me. But i feel it's too much effort to workout just to stay barely toned. \n\nSame for my shoulders and pecs. \n\nI'll feel too much of my free time is being lost at the gym for a goal that isn't really very high. \n\nThe idea of not going any more has been growing in my mind and I think I'm finally gonna commit to it. \n\n\nEdit: i said nothing about steroids or getting super swollen.

First of all I\u2019m the eldest daughter, so that already makes the stereotype of being angry. But the thing is, I\u2019m really not. Not when it comes to life or other people. She (my mom) specifically just knows how to press my buttons and I get so triggered. Or maybe I just don\u2019t have the patience when it comes to her. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have the typical responsibilities of the \u201colder daughter\u201d resulting in the A-type personality. Actually the opposite tbh. She literally would talk to anyone of my cousins instead of me and treat me as her daughter, talking, taking them out whenever they come to visit etc. and I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m jealous because I\u2019m glad they have an aunt they feel free and open with esp cuz one of my cousins mom (her sis) died so there\u2019s that sympathy too.

And it\u2019s always at least 3 times a month someone comes. Literally so annoying. I don\u2019t get my space. I don\u2019t get to express myself freely. Anytime I say something remotely in the wrong tone cuz I\u2019m stressed about other factors in my life, she\u2019ll call me stubborn, impatient and short tempered. Which then makes me angry. There\u2019s nothing I can do to fix it. She says idk how I turned out like this but she\u2019s literally the reason why. She\u2019s the youngest on her side of the family btw and her sisters have told me she was a stubborn kid and always did whatever she wanted. And so yeah sorry I got the same characteristics as her but how is that my fault. She can\u2019t let me do shit. Why is it that she tries to control me when she should recognize the independence behind my intention. Does she hate the fact that I don\u2019t need her for anything cuz I would much rather figure things out by myself even if I hurt myself. I would literally burn my hand on the stove to see what happens even if she tells me/shouts at me to not do it. Yes I\u2019m that stubborn. \n\nI know son-mother relationships are always better compared to the daughters. Obviously that\u2019s not true for everyone but it is for me. Shouldn\u2019t father-daughter relationships just be as good then. Then why is it that I have neither while my younger brother gets both. Sorry I\u2019m not as academically smart as him or as charismatic or insanely gifted with qualities that makes literal strangers love him. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t even know that he was the reason why I didn\u2019t k*ll myself on that night years ago. I thought about him and no way he\u2019ll survive my parents without needing his big sister esp when he\u2019s older.

And shit talks me behind my back with my mom.

(College dorm edition) ", "id": "1hraffz", "created_utc": 1735759917.0, "selftext": "\nMy roommate and I were friends for over two years. We've roomed together since freshman year (we are juniors), and just recently, things went downhill. A lot of things lead up to this point in time. Let me say that I am someone who ALWAYS extends the olive branch first when the going gets rough. My roommate was cool with my partner and we all hung out together. My roommate and I agreed that my partner could spend the weekend in our dorm. Because of my roommate's major, she was rarely in the dorm room. We stopped hanging out so much and she started to get grumpy. We have different views when it comes to specific things and I think that bothers her. My religion for example...... anyways. When I noticed the change in her mood, I would ask her what was going on but she always said she did not want to talk about it. \nDuring election week, I asked her if my partner could stay over election night because it was a difficult time for everyone and my roommate was super grumpy and stopped spending time with me. She said yes. I needed the support and was not receiving any from my roommate and she didn't seem to care for me so I started spending more time with my partner. Rule of thumb: never argue over text. and do watch your language. Because it's gotten me to this point. \n\nFinally, in mid-November, I'd had enough of my roommate's BS so I texted her saying that if she did not want to be friends anymore, she should just say it because I felt stupid trying to spend time with her only for her to lie to my face saying that she's busy. I told her she was being very grouchy, creating a negative energy in the room. She texted me back saying that she thought I should stop victimizing myself because I'm the problem. From there, we started throwing insults at each other. She said that I should have asked her how she was feeling (I have) and noticed that she was upset (I did) so I could \"fix\" myself. I am not going to repeat what was said over text at that moment but you should know, it was really bad. Long story short, I reminded her of the open communication agreement on the contract and she told me that I needed to open my eyes more. All that needed to happen was a mature in-person conversation... She told me that we could not talk and live in the same room independently but I said \"If that's your attitude, I want you out of this room.\" How am I supposed to know whats wrong if I ask that very question and she says she doesn't wanna talk about it? Everything seems to revolve around her. \n\nWhat comes next is something that would be twisted around too many times. My roommate came back to grab a few things to stay with a friend. No conversation. So I call her and I don't get an answer. Soon enough she comes back with a group of her morally corrupt \"friends\" packed up her things and vacated the room. On their way out, one of them shoved me into my desk. At around three in the morning, they came back to write \"You're going to die, little bitch\" on the whiteboard on my door and bang on it to wake me up. I was terrified that she was going to come back into the room and hurt me or something. \n\nThe next day, \"You are an evil person\" was written on my whiteboard. Campus safety changed the lock to my room and my partner bought me a ring camera. There is a no-contact order between us and we are not allowed to associate with anyone who is friends with the other. My roommate is going around saying that I packed up her things and moved her out which is completely untrue and now the school is investigating it. There's this app called yak yak. All of the posts in my school forum are Anon so you can't see who they're actually from which is why people tend to be so bold on there. A couple of posts were made about me. I won't share all of them:\n\n\" A mother's love should be unconditional, but there's a really good reason that your's hates you. (you know who you are. bitch.)\" \n\n\"Being a Jew (a different word was used), ugly, and a bitch is crazy. pick a struggle.\" \n\nThey exposed my room number. They also told me to kms. My roommate told them about my past attempts and my personal information, my eating disorder stuff and history. Now the girls are using it against me.  \n\n\"The fact that you failed to kys three times just proves what a failure you are. Maybe this will give you some courage to do it right this time. Lol.\" \n\nThe comments are horrible. People are saying I should die, that I am a loser and a horrible person, and that I don't belong here. Two people (who I know) have been fighting back for me in the comments. I wouldn't have known about this bullying unless someone told me about it. I am not on Yikyak because I know how toxic it is. Someone in the comments exposed the people behind the posts and then it got deleted so I know who is behind them. They were in my room the night my roommate moved out and one of them pushed me. Of course, the school can't take action with this yik yak stuff because it's anon, and the cops said they can't do anything cause bullying isn't a crime. Now my roommate is saying that she wants the room back and she wants to kick me out of the room. The school has not been very receptive to my concerns and my side of the story and I feel like they are mocking me. By Friday, they will decide whether or not I am guilty of moving her out and violating student conduct. I am innocent. A lot of her motives are antisemitic and she has made that very clear on Yik yak. My RA is saying I did too and she was not even present at the time all of the girls were packing. All of the people involved said that they did not pack any of her things up or help her. I feel that there is no hope and the school is against me. They have no physical evidence but I do have a picture of her packing. I'm not sure if they will use it to prove my innocence but then again, they aren't supporting me. I am upset and lost, and no one at school cares. She has turned everyone against me so I have one friend at school. My girlfriend has been such an amazing support and I feel bad because it has caused us to have a few arguments here and there but we are going strong. She says that we are doing this together and I love her so much.

I left my parents at 17 (went off to college in other state) and moved to another city in my early 30s for a job opportunity. In all those years I learn: self resilient, sacrificing and self awareness. \nThese are all things my husband lacks. \n\nI watch him waste food, don't clean up after himself and freaks out when we got an unsupected bill once (I have money saved for times like this so it was like \"water off a ducks back\" to me). I told him, if we were living with roommates, we would conspire to kick him out the house based on cleanliness alone.\n\n Just the other day he did not know what \"hunger pains\" were, he thought he was sick until I asked him when was the last time he ate. I literally survived on hot dogs and spaghetti in college. I had times in my 20s where I had to choose which bills to pay so I dont loose my apt. I shopped second hand and took furniture off the curb. \n\nI do not have a community to rely on, I had/have to navigate the world through trial and error while he floats along.

Fine. Its in her nature to be empathetic and the most innocent of the group.

My guy stared at her for 10 seconds and she was wooed.\nBut somehow the show glorifies that, like she took badass revenge against a scumbag. \n\nAnd if we\u2019re on the topic of hurting people, if it was such a big deal in episode 6 that the lower 4 doesnt hurt the upper 4 because theyre better and more righteous than them, why is it suddenly justified in the last few episodes for something that wasnt even remotely as terrible?\n\nAnd the last conflict before this shitshow ended was when floor number 1 spent 1 billion won only to get an instruction card. How the ever loving fuck is that the final conflict. SOME OF THESE PLAYERS HAVE OVER 20 BILLION WON. EACH. \n\nLike what floor 2 said she can give a portion of her winnings to floor 1. Alternatively when the show ends follow number 8 and make her give a portion of her sum to everyone who endured her tyranny. I dont care if you have to waterboard it out of her but its definitely possible. \n\nThe worst thing about this crisis is that floor 7 suddenly starts blabbing about how he doesnt know what to do. Hes survived and planned through so much but THIS easily fixable inconvenience is what breaks his character after zero buildup or foreshadowing again. Just out of the blue \u201cguys\u2026 i dont know what im doing \ud83d\ude2b\ud83e\udd7a\u201d\n\nHELLO???  that completely broke his character apart for no reason with no pay off. Hes just the stereotypical smart guy in every show just that they shoved in a character moment that made no sense so that he doesnt seem so two dimensional.\n\nAND THEN THE 1ST FLOOR GUY. WHAT WAS THE POINT OF HIM KILLING HIMSELF?? HIS WHOLE CHARACTER ARC WAS TO SAVE MONEY FOR HIS DAUGHTER. \n1.) hes already getting a billion won from floor 2 \n2.) if he needed more he could have asked ANY ONE of the allies he made like 7 who had over 20 billion won\n3.) extort the money from 8 and or 6 while theyre still in the show and no laws apply\n\nBut what does he decide to do? Kill himself because ???? The show needed a finale and the authors couldnt think of anything smart\nThat whole ending sequence made no sense with his backstory in mind. HE HAS THE MONEY. HE HAS THE FREEDOM. HIS DAUGHTERS WAITING. WHATS THE PROBLEM??\n\nAND NUMBER 8. SHE DOES THE MOST FUCKED UP SHIT TO ALL OF THEM but she gets no consequences for her actions. NOTHING. Not a drop of her blood was shed throughout the game. You could argue that it was to portray the unfairness of life people have to deal with, but then why include that weak ass \u201cshe committed a crime and went to jail\u201d subplot in the last 20 seconds of the finale??? If you want to tell a story about the unfairness and hierarchy present in our society atleast stick to it instead of copping out for a cheap \u2018taste of your own medicine\u2019 in the last lap of the series.\n\nLastly i dont even know where to start with floor 4.

You cant even attribute it to wanting to maximise her money because even when on the \u201cwinning\u201d side she switches to the losing side ON A WHIM.\n\nIts so annoying that all the characters are braindead and none of their motivations are explained or elaborated on.

I live in an in-law apartment belonging to family. I was taking out the recycling and trash bins which are on the far other side of the house. I hadn't checked the weather this morning since it was warm the day before so I didn't think twice about the weather conditions until I got outside and the grass was crunchy from ice. I had to walk across the grass through the large yard over to the other side where the bins are kept. Then I have to take them up a long steep driveway to the top of the street. I felt I had to get the recycling out because I finally got the energy to break down all the many boxes that had accumulated during the last few months. I share the bins with family and they always fill the recycling up leaving no room for mine. As they are out of town, this was my chance to get rid of it all. Had that not been the case, I might have not taken the bins out at all once I saw the ice.\n\nPrior to today, I missed all of the Christmas holidays due to a severe diverticulitis attack and am still very weak and not well from complications, but, as I said, this was my chance. I looked at the driveway, and parts looked free of ice, so I stuck to the side where it looked the safest. I took the tiniest baby steps, but it gets the steepest at the top and it got more icy (black ice is hard to see on asphalt). Close to the top, I slipped and fell on my right knee. I was OK, though, although I scraped my knee (and now it is swollen). I pull the bins behind me as I have weakness in my arms and a messed up back from a fall last winter, so pushing it is harder than pulling it. As I fell, the bin started sliding back down the driveway behind me. I got up and decided I was OK, and I was still determined to get it up the last 15 feet or so. I decided to move it onto the grass and pull it back up that way, but there is a ground level brick planter area with bark mulch covering the last four feet. I decided the bark mulch would be less frozen and slippery, but I was oh so wrong. I slipped again and this time, because my arms were behind me, I fell forward only able to bring my right arm (I am right handed) up at the last moment. I broke my fall with my face, right smack onto the frozen bark mulch.\n\nI luckily didn't break my front teeth out, although that was a distinct possibility, and I didn't break my glasses, which is good because I'm poor and they are expensive. But frozen bark mulch is not a great surface, and I skinned a huge chunk off between my nose and upper lip; I have scratches all down my nose and right cheek and chin; and I started bleeding like crazy. I lay there for a few minutes, as you do, and then crawled back onto the frozen lawn and crawled until the ground was level, and made my way back to my upstairs in-law apartment with blood pouring off of my face. I then spent a couple of hours cleaning the bark mulch out of the wounds with peroxide (which is either the right thing or the wrong thing to do depending on which Google hit you read). I bit through a ton of my upper lip inside and my lower lip, and I'm bummed about the strip between my nose and lips, because it will undoubtedly scar (I tend to keloid scars). My upper lip looks like I've had fillers - I have a bloody trout pout which is not particularly attractive. I have been shaking a lot today, and I don't know if that is some residual type of shock thing or not.\n\nI'm a pretty stoic person, but this was kind of the last straw. I know that my already being physically weakened has a lot to do with it, but I feel defeated at the moment. I hurt. My whole face hurts. My knee hurts. My elbow hurts. I look scary. It hurt to eat, so I only had a muffin for the whole day. And to cap it off, the pain from the diverticulitis is worse and so is the problem with the complications from that. Oh, and the recycling can is still sitting on the lawn, and the trash men didn't pick it up, even though they could see it sitting there. They could have just grabbed it and taken it five feet to the street, but I guess that's not part of their job. So the recycling bin will be full when the family gets back, which is just great.\n\nI'm alone, which is 99% of the time OK with me. I will probably be much better tomorrow, or rather, later today.

Most carriers will discontinue a customer phone number after only a few months of nonpayment.\n\nAny \"security\" related issues could be resolved by simply making it a priority to ensure that people are aware of how easily they could potentially lose access to tons of information and services that are essential for their livelihood and continued employment. For example Google should be extremely clear and explicit FROM THE START that a work around should be in place for when someone loses access to a device or phone number. \n\nHard backup codes exist. Other forms of authentication exist. Biometric authentication exists even on many more \"affordable\" devices. (People in these situations often still have their phone, just no cell service, so they can potentially use them on wifi.) I would also ask that you consider the way normalizing phone/device authentication actually discourages proper security practices. Why should anyone worry about making a \"secure\" password or -- god forbid! -- using a password manager when their phone just magically remembers that it's them?\n\nPeople often run multiple connected Google accounts for different purposes and even if you have the opportunity to change a 2FA source for a while, you may not be fully vigilant in managing that process across every single account across multiple services (for example, even other services that use connected Google accounts as auth often keep their own 2FA source on file.)\n\nThe fact of the matter is that \"good\" passwords are quite secure. After 15 or so characters the entropy of brute forcing is infeasible for even the most intense distributed computing sources. Obviously dictionary attacks and rainbow tables exist, but a good password manager essentially nullifies these problems. (Because rules based attacks don't work on random noise, and using a different password for each account makes the prospect of known hash lookups much less valuable to collect, store, and distribute.)\n\nEven then, there are much more reasonable solutions when someone loses a 2FA source than \"lolol too bad, idiot.\" If someone uses a simple password to change a 2FA source then you could instantiate a kind of \"provisional period\" where the old 2FA source is alerted of the change and certain other security critical functions (i.e., financial transactions, deleting large amounts of stored data, changing the password, etc.)\n\nIn the case of a malicious attack, the holder of the \"proper\" 2FA source would be alerted of the change, and still have access to their password and the original 2nd factor, thus being able to \"outvote\" and revoke the illegitimate change. The only possible attack this enables would involve not only having a compromised password but also knowing that the target had currently lost access to all other authentication factors. This situation could potentially be \"engineered\" to happen, but I don't know if you realize this, you can also just use physical force to make someone \"authenticate\" their account for you if you so choose.\n\nSaying that this policy is strictly for \"security\" reasons is at best naive and at worst disingenuous. Every security policy has implicit trade offs and a company makes it clear what they value by privileging a wider market of users that can essentially \"get away with\" bad password protocol at the expense of greatly disadvantaging people who already have the fewest resources to help themselves.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

A place where you can escape into another world, discover new ideas, and find answers to your biggest questions, all without spending a dime. That\u2019s the library.\n\nFor me, libraries have always been magical. When I was a kid, we didn\u2019t have much money. My mom worked hard to provide for my sister and me, but buying books or encyclopedias (this was the 80s) wasn\u2019t always an option. I was a relentlessly curious child, constantly asking questions about how things worked or why the world was the way it was. At the time, we didn\u2019t know I was on the spectrum; we just knew I had an endless thirst for knowledge.\n\nInstead of being overwhelmed by my questions, my mom found a way to nurture my curiosity. She took my sister and me to the library. There, surrounded by shelves full of books, I felt like the whole world was within reach. I\u2019d sit on the floor with books stacked around me, diving into anything that caught my eye. Dinosaurs one day, outer space the next... it didn\u2019t matter. The library was my refuge, a place where my imagination could run wild.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for me to stay quiet when people dismiss libraries as outdated. They\u2019re not just buildings full of books; they\u2019re spaces where kids like me (kids who might not have much but have endless questions) can find answers, inspiration, and dreams.\n\nToday, libraries have grown even more. They offer e-books, audiobooks, and streaming services. They\u2019re not just about books; they\u2019re about opportunity.\n\nSome people argue, \"Why bother with a library when you can just buy what you need on Amazon?\" And sure, that\u2019s an option if you want to spend money. But why pay for something when the library gives it to you for free? And libraries offer more than just books. They provide local resources, community programs, and a chance to explore authors or genres before committing to buy. They\u2019re more than a place to borrow; they\u2019re a place to discover.\n\nMy mom passed away when I was in my twenties, long before she got to meet her grandchildren. But I take my kids to the library just like she took me. We don\u2019t need to go; we\u2019re fortunate enough to afford all the books they could ever want, and the internet makes finding answers easy. But I still take them because of what it represents: the magic, the wonder, and the love my mom showed me by giving me the world through books.\n\nWhen I see my kids sitting on the floor surrounded by books, just as I once did, I feel her presence. And I hope they\u2019ll carry that magic forward, too.\n\nMaybe libraries aren\u2019t just about resources. Maybe they\u2019re about connection... to the world, to our past, and to the people we love.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

The games are random chance and don\u2019t even allow the contestants to compete. Episode 1 and people already have to volunteer to be eliminated or take a bribe. Episode 2 SAME THING.

There was a little hint on it maybe they would play some fun variations of games that require skill, knowledge or teamwork. No let\u2019s drop a stupid ball, have people voluntarily leave and do the lamest trivia I\u2019ve ever heard. They could\u2019ve done so much more with this.

When I first started, I was getting at least 40 hours a week and usually a little overtime. Usually, production numbers go up in the summer. But in the summer of 2023, production levels were about equal to those at other times of the year. It was the same this year. Now, I'm sometimes not even getting more than 30 hours a week. So even though my hourly rate is a decent amount above what it was when I first started (because of raises), I'm not making much more than when I first started.\n\nThe thing that's really pissing me off is that the company wants to keep as many people in the department as it did a few years ago, instead of adapting to changing circumstances. We had 1 person off this whole week and I still didn't get to 8 hours on any day. I just don't understand why the company wants to hire more people instead of employing fewer hourly associates and giving them more work.\n\nAnother thing that annoys me is that two salaried superiors are always telling me, \"Just go help out another department.\" I don't want to do this for two reasons.\n\n1. The company doesn't really do any cross training. So when I go to another department, I often feel like I'm getting in the way because I have to ask for clarification about a lot of tasks.\n2. The other departments often don't need help. And I don't want to help if I'm not really needed. If I can go to another department and give them some relief on a heavy day, I can feel good about that. But if I'm just going to turn an 8 hour day for them into a 7 hour day, I can't feel good about that. I'm not so self centered that I don't think about how everyone else is trying to get to 40 hours per week as well.\n\nAnd then there's the behavior of one of my superiors. He's salaried and complains about the amount of time he has to work all the time in front of me, even though we work 7 hours a day (at most) these days. And he arguably has the best situation of all of us. The two other salaried people in the department usually work 9 or 10 hours a day because they have to come in earlier. It just seems insensitive to me since he knows I want more hours. Earlier this year, it was announced that we were going to lose some customers in another state (because the company's facility in that state started to become more efficient), and in our brief daily meetings he'd always express his happiness at that, as if it would be a good thing for *all* of us. I can understand why he was happy about that, but I wish he could've celebrated privately.\n\nLike I said, I think the department's not going to be around for much longer, so I'm trying to get off this sinking ship. I haven't found a new job yet because I wanted to find something a few notches above this current job. But I think I may just settle for something that pays what I make now but can guarantee 40 hours a week. Even a temporary job. I sure am going to be happy when I can give my 2 weeks' notice.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I don't have exactly the most healthy lifestyle, I have smoked weed, vaped, and drank a heavily over the past few years. All the tests that have been done show that nothing is wrong with my heart and I was not actively having a heart attack anytime I visited an emergency room from this pain. \n\nIt's typically worsened at night when I'm laying back for whatever reason and it will usually start out a little left from the center of my chest as a dull pain that begins to radiate and grow across the entire left side of my chest occasionally feeling numb from the center of my chest to my shoulder. Due to the only recent addition to my habits having been lisinopril at the time I was changed over to losartan, as well as Omeprazole in case it was caused by GERD. These meds have felt like they the reduced the severity of these instances, but they're still happening. Perhaps placebo thinking these meds are what's needed?\n\nSince the cardiologists have said my heart is healthy, my primary care physician believes it's either caused from a musculoskeletal issue or by anxiety and stress. Regardless of whatever causes it, not knowing for certain definitely makes me even more bothered by it and fearful when it happens. I have worked on my habits as well, reducing my overall alcohol intake to just socially and quitting smoking weed. Funny enough I never experienced it when I drink. Quitting vaping is the next step. I'm really not sure what else I can do but every time it happens I have this thought in the back of my head that going to the emergency room is going to be a waste of time because of my previous experiencs, until one day it actually is a severe and potentially life-threatening problem that's diagnosable which I'll try to shrug off due to experiencing these problems nearly nightly. It like my body is becoming the boy who cried wolf and when the real crisis occurs my mind wont react to it.\n\n\nTLDR: I experience near nightly chest pain that makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack and no one can seem to diagnose it or provide solutions.

I successfully paid off all my cc debt (20k) last year with my husband by the Dave Ramsey baby steps model of not spending... I was addicted to retail therapy so I get how hard the habit is to break. I'm still mad at my friends for complaining when they do it. \n\nI have two friends the same age as me (30) who make more than me and pay less rent/utilities than I pay etc (cause we talk about our expenses), and they keep complaining about not being able to pay off their debt. I am recently helping one out by renting a spare room in my house for $500 and no utility fee in San Francisco, CA area. \n\nThese last two weeks I been hanging out with my friends more and they both keep spending and spending and spending - and I always decline the spend opportunity. Like today! We went on a hike today an hour away and they stopped 3 times for fancy coffee and snacks at boutique places. I skipped out. I suggested they bring jackets for the weather, they said no, then bought one for $60 at the nearest gift shop. This happens often, they 'don't have' a clothing piece to be comfortable so they buy the next one they see. \n\nThen they wanted to stop at a vintage clothing store and spent $200 each (a $200 jacket, and two dresses). Then they wanted crab for dinner and spent $300 on crab. Not a special occasion. I bought and ate a $13 noodle plate and skipped the big ass bill. At dinner they started planning a trip out of state and one of them booked tickets. Not me! \n\nThey asked me for my opinion before they made purchases and I tell them straight up they spend too much (\"I wouldn't do that if I were trying to pay down debt\") and they'll say things like \"I got a $500 bonus it's fine\" and I'll say \"that could be $500 less debt you have\" and they shrug. It's not just today.. . Now that I live with one of them, she is constantly eating at restaurants, or buying groceries and letting them spoil every week! Both of them always ask me to join them and if I decline, they offer to pay for me. I'm tired of it, and still decline. \n\nAgain, I make the least of my 2 friends (one is a director of a nonprofit, the other a tenured teacher in highest paying district) and they bring up how I'm making the least. But how I understand it at the end of the day, it's not how much you make - it's how much you keep! \n\nI'm just tired of having to see them blow up their finances and me having to be 'the logical friend' as they say it. I care about them and tell them it sucks to see them like this, but they acknowledge they have a problem and resolve to do better in the future but don't. I also hate being on a budget and meeting my goals, and not bringing my friends along to succeed with me. I feel like a bad guy, tho I'm doing the right thing. It sucks to keep turning them down, but also they shouldn't be going out either! \n\nI also feel like it's setting us up in the long run to where my friends will need my help financially and I'll have to turn them down because it's literally 'I told you so', and also no one making $120,000 should be asking someone making $60,000 for money. And I would not give it to them. \n\nAlso, I'm pissed off that I'm letting one of them live for cheap at my place and she blows it on bullshit. She's moving out soon and I'm glad, so it doesn't keep making me pissed off. \n\nEnd of rant= at the end of the day you can't control people, but you can work on not enabling them.

After half an hour of talking to her, I needed a couple hours alone to cry. Somehow she knows exactly what to say, when, with what intonation, to hit the hardest. It's a natural talent. Sometimes it takes hours of serious thinking to figure out what was so painful about her words. \n\nShe said to my 3yo kid \"**are you the only one, or all of you at preschool are such brainless apes?**\" because he played with his jacket inside.  \nShe **called him stupid** for preferring different shape of fruit slices than her.  \nShe said that **I look so f\u0430t in this dress** (my favorite dress, and Ive recently given birth)   \nShe says that **I ruined her back, that I made it bend so much** (she has a cardio stimulator, and she got a habit of not using her left hand, she was supposed to avoid it while healing, but the habit stayed and caused spine curvature)  \nShe said that **I'm cruel and I p\u043eked my cat's eye out**, while I was mourning watching him in his last days (the eye was damaged by fastly spreading cancer), **she said that I kn\u043ecked his teeth out** (we had his tooth removed in a vet clinic for medical necessity).   \nShe never says please and thanks, but gets offended if I don't say that to her or if remind her to say it sometimes.   \nShe interrupts any conversation that I have with anyone, anytime she wants, but when I join the conversation she's having, without interrupting mind you, she says \"**shut your mouth, I wasn't talking to you**\"\n\nAnd the list is endless, it's just the way she is.

{"post": {"title": "Why do we accept the unacceptable? ", "id": "1hpex49", "created_utc": 1735532660.0, "selftext": "We have got to stop accepting the unacceptable. This idea has been co-opted, like all important ideas, by political discourse. \u201cThe unacceptable\u201d has become synonymous with \u201cthe ideology opposite my own\u201d (as if individuals truly hold a unique ideology rather than having adopted one through their computer, television or phone). Being liberal, or conservative, does not keep one from accepting the unacceptable. Rather, it is the filter for which unacceptable behavior one is willing to accept. And it is only a partial filter, much of what is unacceptable permeates both sides of the political aisle, largely related to refusing to accept information that requires them to even slightly adjust their belief system, regardless of the source. \n\nAmong the unacceptable we should stop accepting are hyper-violent and hyper-sexualized media (keyword: hyper), excessive advertisement, \u201cmind control\u201d such as the previous examples but also other media and political speeches designed to control, tyrannical behavior in personal relationships (another attempt to control), addiction (you can become addicted to anything that releases dopamine), excess conformity, demands for excess consumerism, and much more. \n\nIn order for one to begin the journey to rejecting the unacceptable, one must first actively detach themselves from their usual consumption. It begins, for most millenials and younger, with putting down their phone a bit more often, deleting/deactivating or otherwise drastically reducing their exposure to social media (especially YouTube, Facebook, TikTok and Reddit), and engaging in their offline existence. In addition to this, and for older adults, it involves rethinking what you consume (food, coffee, alcohol, smoking, etc.). The first step to rethinking is a pause to reflect on why you're consuming this particular item. Second, ask yourself what the benefits and drawbacks are. Lastly, ask yourself if, deep down, it's really what you want at that moment. While most people would benefit from cutting out alcohol and smoking entirely, at least significantly reducing caffeine consumption, and eating a diet free of or low in processed foods, the ideal habits for each person greatly vary in the details. \n\nAmong the unacceptable lies the belief that our inner voice doesn't matter. Too often, we speak with our \u201couter\u201d or reactionary voice, feeling as though we must get a word in from a position of authority. Examples of this include chiming in on too much online discourse, insisting that our view is the correct one and that we should be treated as an authority on a subject we have minimal and/anecdotal knowledge on at best. Our inner voice speaks, quietly, to us, what we need to say. It speaks out truth. It requires effort to hear. Accepting our inner voice and bringing its words to our vocal chords serves as another defense against the unacceptable. When the unacceptable comes to us over and over again in a personal relationship, vocalizing our inner voice, \u201cI've had enough. I won't accept this behavior anymore,\u201d can create a necessary boundary.\n\nAccepting our inner voice can prevent us from accepting our own unacceptable behaviors as well. The inner voice warns us when our actions aren't lining up with our integrity. Integrity goes beyond society's versions of right and wrong. It serves as an inner compass to align us with our authentic selves. You may feel, through exhaustion, or peer pressure, that you should not seek proper guidance in a task you're not knowledgeable on, until your inner voice nudges you to override that external pressure, likely saving you (and anybody else relying on your success in that particular venture) a headache. \n\nA later part of the journey of rejecting the unacceptable involves accepting the parts of yourself that have been ignored in favor of the unacceptable. Humans have limited capacity. Hence why only so much can get done in a day. When we accept the unacceptable, we abandon, at least partially, the acceptable. These days, it feels as though the most common acceptable phenomena we abandon are the ones naturally occurring inside of us. A thought, a belief, an idea or a behavior that comes naturally to us and expresses our true selves can easily be the first to go once we begin to make room for the unacceptable. This can make us feel, ironically, as though we shouldn't accept it. Retraining ourselves to accept our own natural being and expression can take some effort. However, once the unacceptable has made its way out, the acceptable often naturally makes its way back since it is just that: natural to us. \n", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Since then, the dementia has got worse as she keeps asking me the same questions when I see her, the big one being \"have you got a girlfriend\" (more on that later).\n\nShe is a very jovial and upbeat person and has actually been really supportive of me and not been on one side of the other with my parents divorcing. She makes me really like that generation and I think the \"war\" generation is the best we've ever seen.\n\nNow luckily she could visit this year for Christmas dinner and I asked my Dad to recreate the same photo from 2022. We had a great time: playing games, having laughs and of course the Xmas dinner.\n\nBut this is where I began to get emotional. At the end of the night she said \"Well I suppose this is the last time I'll see you all\" and this hit hard. My cousin and I made eye contact but just pushed it away thinking it was nothing. But it's stayed in the back of my head since and really hurts that... I may never get to show her the girlfriend she has been asking me about this whole time.\n\nBut I feel, that death is a scary thing of course it is but we should all cherish our loved ones.

I\u2019d switched my diet on my own volition earlier in the year as an attempt to lose weight and build a healthier relationship with food. In my opinion I did a great job with the occasional episodes here and there - lost weight, was eating sugar in moderation, got a gym membership. And then boom A1c of 6.3\nI figured all the years of binging had caught up to me and so I put myself on a stricter diet and completely cut out carbs and all things sugary, started going to the gym more often again. Was losing hella weight and quite close to my goal weight in fact. And then exactly one month ago, something emotionally triggering occurred, and I snapped. I binged in ways I haven\u2019t binged in years for the duration of an entire month up until now. And you know, as much as I care, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m just so numb. I don\u2019t want to be a diabetic after all this but I\u2019m just so tired of the cycle. And I\u2019ve tried the therapy offered by my universitys health center while in college. I\u2019m not sure if trying therapy again would even solve my problems. I\u2019m tired of having a million restrictions from all the food allergies and now health problems I have. I\u2019m tired of having to create these schedules and restrictions and little safe guards to prevent myself from doing what I just did for the entire month of December. \n\nI hate how terribly insecure I feel stepping out in public because as much as I like to pretend it doesn\u2019t concern me, I\u2019m obsessed with my appearance. Because I have skin conditions that ruin my complexion and so I spend hours each day getting ready by slathering layers of makeup on my face. And it sucks because people really do treat you differently when you look a certain way. Pretty privilege is real. Never got many compliments or anything until about two years ago and I hate the way I live for the external validation. I live for the strangers calling me pretty. Because before it was my appearance, it was my intelligence, and it killed me when I stopped getting that praise. What\u2019s even worse about this is that I feel my poor choices are a form of subconscious punishment in a way. I don\u2019t actually want to overeat or gorge on food but I don\u2019t know what else to do. To get off the train.  There\u2019s a part of me that wants to be caught and discovered and found out about. But I continue to binge in secret because why the hell would I want anyone to find me in such an embarrassing state of zero control? \n\nAnd I recognize the fact my desires are attention seeking to some degree. I know I must save myself yet again. I just think I chose to wait a moment before picking myself back up, and perhaps I waited a moment too late because I\u2019m back to spiraling the way I would years in the past. And it feels every thing I learned for myself this year is just too difficult to employ. I don\u2019t want to employ it because even though this year has honestly been so good to me, I feel a bit tired.\n\nI know I need to get back on track for the sake of my health. And I will. But sometimes I feel like I\u2019m losing myself in a fire I keep accidentally reigniting. And it exists so far beyond just food.

She was the only adult figure we could count on and rely on throughout our childhood. But as I grew older, I began to notice things she had done and said that were clearly manipulative (though I won't go into details).\n\nThe worst turning point in my life came when she could no longer pay the mortgage on the house we had at the time due to her gambling addiction. She had never worked a day in her life and relied solely on rent collections from the storefront and other parts of the house that were rented out to tenants.\n\nEventually, we had to sell the house to avoid foreclosure. Luckily, we found a buyer in time, just before the foreclosure date. After paying off the mortgage, there was at least $200K left.\n\nI was only 16 at the time, hustling for a month to find an apartment before the new owner moved in. We had already hired a broker to find a co-op or condo for us. And guess what happened? She went to the casino and lost the remaining $200K. Not only did we have no money left, but she also owed an additional $50K to some lenders.\n\nWe were on the verge of becoming homeless. My aunt, who was also looking for a new apartment, had to be convinced to let us share a rental space with her in order to have a roof over our heads at the lowest cost possible.\n\nFast forward 10 years, my sister graduated, landed a decent-paying job, and was able to afford to move out to a better apartment. But my mother has remained attached to our lives ever since. We live in a 2-bedroom apartment, and to allocate space for her, my sister and I have had to share a room while she gets one for herself.\n\nIt feels like we are raising a teenager who refuses to work a single day in her life. She clings to us and manipulates us into feeling guilty every time we try to hang out with friends or simply live our own lives. I have never dated in my entire life, and whenever I try to go out, she questions me about where I'm going, what I'm doing, and why I'm going out. Even if my sister and I want to travel, we have to include her. I once said, \"I can pay for your vacation, but you can go with your friends.\" She ended up whining and saying that if it\u2019s not with us, she doesn\u2019t want to go at all.\n\nI cannot start a normal conversation without it turning into an argument. I once brought up the topic of how dependent she is on us, even though she is a perfectly healthy and capable person. I asked her, \"What will happen if I want to get married? What if we both get married?\" She simply responded, \"Then figure out a way to pay for my rent for a nice apartment, and then you can go your way.\"\n\nIn this economy, paying for rent in NYC is already soul-sucking, and for her to have that expectation feels absolutely absurd.\n\nMy lack of love for her grows day by day. It worsened when I found out that my father\u2019s will actually gave my sister and me the right to inherit 1/3 of the house. But she manipulated us when signing the contract to sell the house, preventing us from receiving our share and keeping the money for herself. We trusted her, and this is where my life completely turned upside down. \n\nI am suffocating. I am about to turn 30 next year and my mental stress keeps getting worse. I am stuck. she is mentally burdening me, and I am constantly looping back and fourth between feeling guilt and hatred. I am drowning. It feels like I need to win the lottery in order to leave her behind my life. In the end, all she wants is just financial stability as long as she does not need to work for it anyways right? \n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I\u2019ll tell you what happened starting from 4 years ago (timeline from top to bottom)\n\n- My mom was in a rlly bad relationship in which her bf and his daughter would make my life hell by lying on me and turning my mom against me. I got so angry at her for easily believing their lies and said she was an annoying bitch which led to me (at 12 years old) being thrown, punched, hit, choked, and I was bleeding. Then in 2024 (now) she acts like I just need to go to therapy to get over it.\n\n- When I went to therapy, I had bad problems w her but she wouldn\u2019t let me tell my therapist so I had to keep it to myself while my mom would yap abt me.\n\n- When we have conversations abt my feelings she\u2019s always laughing or smirking if she feels like what I\u2019m saying is ridiculous or just interrupts me. A lot of those conversations lead to yelling and fist fights (she starts this one). \n\n- During my trauma narrative in therapy, I asked her not to make any faces or anything during it while I read cause I wasn\u2019t even comfortable reading it to her in the first place. What the fuck did she do??? Laugh during it and say \u201coh she reminds me of myself\u201d I had to laugh awkwardly but inside I was furious.\n\n- Ever since she started dating her new bf she\u2019s been high and mighty and whenever I bring up unfair rules and stuff she just has her bf to back her up and she tells me I\u2019m wrong. And during family meetings she acts like she could do no wrong. She used to favor my younger brothers and we fought for a YEAR over that which she denied endlessly that she favored them and during that meeting she admitted she did and just said \u201cmy bad\u201d. I was fucking livid.\n\n- Now. My 10yr brother.. I have a deep hatred for him cause he always gets his way and he\u2019s disrespectful most of the time. I avoid him as much as I can and I\u2019ll be polite when he said hi or wtv but that\u2019s all. I\u2019m closer to my youngest brother (8m) cause he doesn\u2019t do that like my 10yr brother does. My mom lets him get away with almost everything because he\u2019s autistic and needs a lot of attention and stuff. I\u2019m also autistic. I brought up how unfair that shit was and her fucking response? He\u2019s just a kid. Same to my youngest brother. But also she said she treated me the same way with my older sister (23f) when I was younger.\n\nMy sister used to beat me and attempt to get me killed and put me in uncomfortable situations because she hated me. I didn\u2019t know why at first. My mom said it was cause I was a girl and she wanted to be the only girl. She treated my younger brother (15m) well just not me. Now I see it\u2019s because of my mom. And I hate her for that. Because she decided to enable my behavior, it was only when I started getting disciplined a lot when I got older that I turned out the way I am. But when I was younger according to my sister I was a demon. Just like my 10yr brother. Why? Because this lady never did anything to stop me. Her reasoning? Because I was \u201cjust a kid\u201d and needed more help mentally. \n\n- Now to my dad. I hate him. With a passion. He allowed my (15m) brother to be abused by his gf and my brother just fucking forgave him. I never will. He\u2019s a deadbeat and only decides to play father when he\u2019s bored. My birthday is Feb 22nd. He texts me on the 23rd saying happy birthday every damn year. He also blames my mom for himself being a deadbeat. He claims she took us from him. I hate him with a passion. Both of them. I feel like they both failed me. Every single conversation I have with him, he also interrupts me and always yaps abt his life, how he\u2019s \u201cdepressed\u201d that he can\u2019t see us (he lives in cali, we live in texas), and that my mom is a monster. He NEVER takes accountability. She barely does. \n\n- My sister.. just like I mentioned before, terrible. Now she\u2019s nicer and stuff but she\u2019s never apologized and still favors my brother over me. I hate her too. I hate all of them. I can\u2019t get over what she did and nothing will ever make me forgive her. \n\nI just finished therapy on Halloween. I don\u2019t want to go back. I was in there because my mom\u2019s dad\u2026 did that to me. My relationships are fucked up and so is everything else. Ik I need help mentally but idk anymore. I just feel like everyone here failed me. Badly. \n\nIk this is long, but I feel a lil relieved now that I got it all out here. But I can\u2019t stop myself from losing my mind now.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I don't unplug stuff pulling on the cord, I always grab the connector, if I'm having trouble getting a grip on the connector, I'll figure out whatever I need to do to actually pull on the connector instead of just yanking on the cord. I don't rest my phone on the cord browsing in bed while charging, I never leave my devices plugged in in a way there's tension on the cord or port, I'm pretty sure I have OCD and that treating electronic cables as gently as possible is one of my compulsions because I don't know how to be any other way. As far as I'm concerned you have to do all these things to keep the connections between the connectors and the cable itself in good shape, as well as not damage anything in the female ports of whatever device. I have gone so far as to buy kits of USB C port cleaning brushes and plugs so I can eliminate pocket lint getting into the ports. \n\nDespite this, *every single USB C cable I have ever owned* has lasted maybe a few dozen plugs and unplugs (in practice about 2-6 weeks of use) before reaching this weird state of crappiness where the cord takes a bunch of force inward to click into the port and make a good connection, but then somehow requires so little force to remove from that port just the weight of the cable is plenty to make it fall out. Every USB C device I've owned has a break-in period on the port, as well, where after about a month of making a good click and actually retaining the cable, it just kind of goes a little mushy, developing up and down and side to side play and losing the tactility of the cable clicking in. The only reason I've kept my current phone's port in decent shape is by buying overpriced USB C cables and charging wirelessly as much as possible. Despite this, I can tell I only have a few months left until the port is broken in to the point even a new cable doesn't click in nicely anymore. I have to hold my phone *perfectly fucking still* if I want to use it while it's charging because literally any movement I make is enough to dislodge the cable and stop charging. I literally have to use my other hand a decent amount of force to plug the cable back in any time at all I adjust how I'm sitting or laying or anything. \n\nI have an old LG phone, the USB C port, through not just average but exceptionally gentle use, has broken to the point that the phone can now only charge via USB C (data doesn't work anymore), and it only works with the one specific cable that has broken in alongside the phone in the exact same way, only one orientation of the cable works, it has to have a small object propped under the connector for the cable to put the appropriate torque on the connection, and the cable has to dangle off the surface in the right way or its weight will interrupt the connection even despite the prop under the connector. Everyone I know has had at least one similar experience with a USB C device and/or cable. \n\nApple's Lightning connector lasted 3-4x as long with proper care, before inevitably succumbing to entropy. I'm under no illusions that data/charging cables can last forever with proper care, but this is ridiculous. The lightning connector on my year-old 3rd gen iPhone SE has been absolutely babied every single connection it's ever made, and still feels like new, unlike my 15 Pro's USB C port, which has been treated with the same care and is already mushy. The old 32 pin connector from the first iPhones was such a tank, to produce the sort of \"needs a prop and specific angle to work\" behavior of being worn out, you *had* to abuse the port. I knew maybe one or two people who had a 32-pin dock connector in that poor a shape, and they were the type to unplug devices not just by pulling the cord but just yanking the device itself. I've made a point to care for cables since my first flip phone's micro USB port 15 years ago and my old iPhone 4S's 32 pin connector still clicks in and out nice and crisp like it's brand new. \n\nMark my words, USB C is either going to be replaced as the universal standard for smart devices with something designed for durability, or it will be common for USB C ports to be a module that resides in a larger, more resilient port, allowing them to be swapped out as their durability is expended. There's 1-2 years left before this becomes a mainstream social media talking point, I predict, as notoriously cable-abusive iPhone users start totally killing their ports. Will probably stick around in PC space as a universal high data transfer rate cable that's very convenient to use though.", "subreddit": "rant"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

When I was young (single digits) things were ok enough I guess. Around 11 years old, health problems started to manifest which is what I believe that started my depression which manifested SI. I just wanted things to end and the pain to go away. Mental health was not something ever talked about in my house, so I went with the silence approach. All I would do is play video games and go to friends houses because being \u201chome\u201d was miserable. Started using alcohol and marijuana at 14 years old. I found out that I hated sobriety. Always had good grades and so many in my life stated that I was \u201cgifted\u201d (basically I\u2019m just a quick learner). Around 16 years old, migraines started to become a regular issue (photosensitivity implosive feeling) that lasted around 2-3 days and happened twice a week. They gave me preventatives and hydros which started my opiate addiction. I knew I had GERD and then a ph study with endoscopy confirming GERD with esophagitis and duodenitis. They stated I\u2019ll probably have esophageal cancer at some point in my life. When I didn\u2019t feel terrible, I wasn\u2019t home.\n\n My senior year of high school was my introduction to the \u201creal world\u201d. I got out of school 1145 (once football session was done) and picked up a job working full time hours. A few months after turning 18, I finally got approved for a CT scan and they found out I had a brain tumor and two CVAs (strokes). MRI confirmed this. My neurosurgeon stated it was inoperable due to the location. No one knew how much time I had. For 6 months, I had a weekly MRI done. My substance abuse accelerated because I said fuck it and later graduated with a 4.0 GPA even while using. My life became more reckless because I was chasing adrenaline to feel something and behaviors became more reckless. 6 months passed, and my neurosurgeon stated that my tumor appeared to be benign due to no growth so we moved to biweekly scans. I attended college and just fucked around (was in the college of engineering), but wasn\u2019t taking anything seriously.\n\nAt 19, I noticed that I fit the description for Bipolar disorder type 1 (later diagnosed).\n\nAt 20, I decided I wanted to do something good with whatever time I had left and got into the medical field. I got clean, but still drank alcohol. Finished school and started working EMS and voly fire. It left me with a lot of scars, but I do not regret it. Any time I wasn\u2019t working, I was going out to bars. Shit started getting really dark. SI increased. Had a SA, but the cops got to me before I bled out (this is a whole story in its self). I had been in the psych ward before, but I had to go to court for this one and was in there a little over 3 weeks. Got out, still drinking, but had court appointed therapy and psychiatrist visits weekly or I would have to go back to the ward. Needless to say, I took time off work and attended, but started drinking daily, drug abuse started again, and frequenting bars (rarely drove due to neighbor being the bartender at the establishment I frequented). I was going through $500 a week on cheap booze. I lost some friends along the way and one happened that February 2023 and I just lost it. They admitted me to the ward and I was there for a month (at this point, I had double digit admissions to the lockdown ward). This began my \u201cturning point\u201d imo.\n\nI\u2019ve been sober since the end of February 2023. I have been only many different SSRIs, mood stabilizers, anti psychotics, and benzodiazepines, but this most recent regiment stuck. I still hate being alive and am most likely a nihilist, but I continue on for those close to me. \n\nI got a job as an MA November 2023, and it was great. I decided I was going to finish my BA and go to med school. I gave so much to this job and my providers held me in high regard. The problem was management. Needless to say, new hires came in and were absolutely terrible. I went to the management with solutions and told them I should be promoted to clinical trainer, and initially my boss was for it because I was amazing at my job. Had a meeting with her and her boss where she redacted all support for my promotion. Too many times I was told to be less productive to spur the others forward. Since they started, after their initial training, I showed them how to actually do the job. They were slow paced and were there to socialize instead of work. I ended up leaving after I was told I would have to work with someone who crossed a big personal boundary (they were aware of this). I ended up resigning early December 2024 because all I could think about was getting fucked up and killing myself. I gave them so much and got so little from management.\n\nHere we are. I realized I had become complacent and now I\u2019m trying to get in a non for profit tech job for cheaper tuition and still serving my community. Plan on starting school this fall.

It would sure be nice if I had someone to provide a sort of help I guess in this rather timeless predicament of mine. Sometimes, there\u2019s been a person I\u2019ve thought about when im scared and things like that before, and maybe you can relate. I\u2019ve had a person like that in my life for quite a bit now, a beautiful girl. But as of late, I find thinking of her not as comforting. I\u2019m kind of a wuss to be honest!

The tension in the air when there\u2019s a moment between you two, the tension in your very own body. I guess that can be the heart for now. But, enough of that. The reason it doesn\u2019t work is maybe cuz it\u2019s not official. Maybe it\u2019s cuz I can\u2019t \u201cman up\u201d (what\u2019s the term for that when you\u2019re not a dude?) and just say something already. I mean, homecomings coming up.

I\u2019m onto something, but i won\u2019t let myself chase it. You can make up as many little stories about her and you as you want as you hug something soft whilst half asleep secretly wishing it was her but it\u2019s not gonna be one of the moments that *really, actually* matter. You know, when there\u2019s that little moment where you two are like studying or something and there\u2019s a little break in the conversation and it just so very painfully *hangs* in the air and it\u2019s really only there for just a couple of seconds and you don\u2019t know if *you\u2019re* gonna break the silence and I kinda just wish she would do it so I don\u2019t have to, oh fuck what do I do now, does she feel this too, oh shit haha my face won\u2019t move, and then a word takes ya out of it, maybe you said it maybe you didn\u2019t. I always feel shaken up after those couple seconds, it really changes the whole day. That typa thing is what\u2019s real. That\u2019s what I can always, always remember. Maybe if I tried hard I could remember all I fantasize about whenever I get all yearn-y but on just a whim I could tell you about that very real moment. Like that actually did happen. And I feel so alive when im with her, dude!! I hate how she makes me feel but it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever felt, like a high with no drugs but still the sickness. The hurt, because I just want her to be my normal friend that I don\u2019t have to be stuck in some weird little limbo with but what i want even more is for her to be mine and to go on dates and to actually TELL HER ALL OF THIS BULLSHIT!!!!

Like, I didn't like season 5 of that show and I guess my brain ended up clumping together different animes and being like 'this shit is annoying actually!'\n\nIt's funny too because I recall being an anime watcher and absolutely REFUSING to read the original manga, but now as I got older, I just exclusively read manga- and most of the manga I've read isn't main stream anyway.

I'm just saying, for some reason the most popular stuff doesn't intrest me in the slightest?\n\nIn regards to anime, though, I found that lots of it is just, like, annoying?

A lot of mental illness (including myself - bipolar 2), a lot of narcissism (undiagnosed but pretty clear), and other personality/emotional instabilities. Overall it\u2019s become a very toxic space at home. I fight with my sister not as often as I use to but very intensely. Our fights have lasted up to a year where we wouldn\u2019t speak even while living in the same apartment. She\u2019s always been the \u201cwinner\u201d among us. She was the smartest, brightest, more accomplished. I always got compared to her, and she used me a lot as sort of a a sidekick as a kid. I was basically the lesser version of her in her eyes. It caused a lot of insecurity in me as a kid and teen, but eventually I found myself, and my own niche. We\u2019re complete opposites now in personality, interests, values - nearly everything.\n\nAnyway, a while back around the start of covid she became sick. This was also right after a hard time for myself. I am bipolar so I went through a very hard period of my life. Probably the darkest moment of my life, but I slowly recovered mentally and physically. A couple months later she got a lot worse. She lost a ton of weight, and was have random fevers. We still don\u2019t know exactly what it is but probably an autoimmune disorder of sorts. I started to take care of her a lot, and when we fought I noticed she couldn\u2019t take care of herself, so I would apologize (most of the time for no reason) so that I would be able to help her. I will say, though I do believe her illness is real, we all agreed that her mental state contributed a lot to his physical state, and she would really milk the whole being sick thing. She\u2019s always been an attention seeker and I think she really loved how much she was coddled whenever she got worse. It was like a cycle of being sick - getting validation - getting better - losing validation - getting worse. She was having awful fevers at like 101-102 so she couldn\u2019t be faking it, but it was very strange how her body and mind were connected in that way.\n\nWhenever we fight, she always says the nastiest things to me. She would say things that she knew would trigger me, most recently comparing me to our grandfather who was physically abusive towards our grandmother even after she was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s. His name in this family is synonymous with \u201cnarcissist\u201d, but she was simply pointing out how we were both stubborn. I\u2019ve admitted that I can be stubborn at times which was a huge mistake because it basically gave her license to say that whenever we argued about anything. She always says \u201cyou\u2019ve agreed before, you can\u2019t take it back now.\u201d. It started as a simple debate about dogs sleeping on the bed\u2026 she said it was abusive to not let your dog on the bed. I said that\u2019s not true, because I\u2019ve worked with dogs and I know that they don\u2019t care whether they sleep on memory foam or whatever, its just about being close to their owner and so its just a matter of the owners boundaries & how clean the dog is. All dogs are different but overall, as much as we love them like family, they don\u2019t see us as equals. They see us as either their masters, or their subservients. She thought that was f\u2019ed up to say (she\u2019s the most surface level animal lover to exist. Basically says she loves them but doesn\u2019t even clean up after our senior dogs at home). She all of a sudden started making personal attacks at me just for the sake of making me emotional because she knows I have a mood disorder and there\u2019s no better way to win an argument than to use my own illness against me. She started talking about my insane spending (with my own money mind you, and mostly during my episodes, which aren\u2019t even that bad) and tried to get our parents to turn on me by saying that they were JUST talking about how out of control I am and how useless I am. That\u2019s her favorite tactic, and no one but me acknowledges it. She loves to mention all the conversations that she has with our parents behind my back, and if they don\u2019t respond and agree she turns on them and calls them out for not being honest. She turned a conversation about dogs sleeping on the bed, into a conversation about how everyone in our family talks bad about me behind my back. It\u2019s really amazing honestly, but I\u2019m not a idiot so it didn\u2019t really get under my skin as much as it just disappointed me that my own sister, who I constantly take care of despite everything it does to my social and professional life, want me to feel alienated and ganged up on by my whole family. Because I said that dogs not being allowed on the bed is not abusive.\n\nOur dynamic is so unhealthy, and I notice all the time how I do so much better when we\u2019re fighting, but she does so much worse. I focus more on my work/school, I exercise more, I have more friendships. And when we hang out she becomes my entire circle. I do nothing but lay down with her and watch movies. When we fight I feel so free and myself, but I feel my entire family turn on me. They think I should just apologize like I have in the past so that I can be there for my sister again. I always say I\u2019m tired of it and I won\u2019t do it again but my sister starts withering away. She\u2019s already very frail but when we fight she stops eating completely and even pulls her own hair out. I feel like I\u2019m cursed. When we fight it\u2019s like I have more energy and focus because she\u2019s not my entire concentration, but my entire family essentially hates me because they see me as selfish. Even after everything she\u2019s said to me (wishing SA on me, wishing a miscarriage on me, etc) all with no greater context other than she felt like she was \u201closing\u201d or missing out on something, I always have to be the bigger person, but I get taken for granted anyway.\u00a0\n\nSorry that was a lot, I really needed to rant. I\u2019m not by any means claiming to be a perfect person but I do a lot for my sister, and I make a lot of sacrifices that I don\u2019t see back. She never has to wonder if I care about her but all the time I think to myself \u201cwould she do the same for me?\u201d and the answer is almost always no. There\u2019s not much I can do \u2019til I move out which she claims won\u2019t happen even once I graduate since she hasn\u2019t been able to move out, but if anyone has any validating or encouraging words I\u2019d appreciate it.

{"post": {"title": "Have I lost my best friend?", "id": "1hny8b8", "created_utc": 1735361496.0, "selftext": "\n\nI (21f) have been best friends with \u201cEverest\u201d (20f) since we were in 3rd grade together. We\u2019ve bonded through the years via inside jokes, shared friends, and being able to have deep or heavy conversations. We\u2019ve been with each other through our darkest times (like attempts at s**cide and other heavy matters). \n\nTLDR: \nEverest is almost definitely being used as a rebound relationship by this guy. I communicated that friendship felt one-sided since she started dating guy (sorta understandable). I decided to stop texting first, we haven\u2019t spoken in 4 months and she\u2019s ignoring me for an unstated / unknown reason. \n\n(TLDR at beginning since I know this is gonna be a fairly lengthy post)\n\nEverest is a manager at a local car wash and has been for the last year or so. This guy \u201cMitchell\u201d (26(?)m) is another manager of the same chain, but different nearby location. Everest, who previously identified as lesbian, started texting me saying she thinks she likes a guy at work. We joked a little bit abt her sexuality (cuz that\u2019s the type of relationship we have, I\u2019m bisexual for reference). I then start asking her more about this guy. She\u2019s describing him and he seems great and I\u2019m ecstatic for her. She\u2019s been very shy in the past, so this is something big for her. \n\nWe decided to talk about everything over FaceTime because that was easier for us. Everything about Mitchell seems great, until she mentioned that he broke off an engagement. Which whatever, it happens, no judgment. Because I was once in the horrible situation of being the freshly-broken-up person in a rebound, I wanted to double check this breaking off wasn\u2019t super recent so I could warn her if needed. I asked Everest if she was talking about broken engagement like 2 years ago or 2 months ago. She told me 11 days ago. Immediate red flags. I explained to her my experience with being on the opposite end as her and I advised her not to get into the relationship. Maybe wait like 3 months so he can at least heal a little, and if feels are still there, then go for it. Ultimately, Everest is her own person and I want her to make her own decision regardless of my opinion. I told her I think she shouldn\u2019t get into the relationship right now, but ultimately she\u2019s her own person and I\u2019ll support whatever option she chooses. \n\nRight then, Everest was like \u201cokay, I\u2019m gonna go tell him what you said and I\u2019ll break things off with him\u201d. Mitchell and Everest met up and she told me that Mitchell said he really wanted a future with Everest, and they\u2019re now dating. Everest texted me saying she was so happy that they\u2019re finally together. A little strange considering not even an hour ago, they were gonna break up. But eh, whatever. I brush it off. Since she\u2019s so happy and I didn\u2019t know what else to say, I told her I was happy for her. \n\nAll of this had happened over summer break. Since I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to see Everest during the school year, I asked a few times when she was free to hang out. We would always get really close to finding a date to hangout, then things would fall through. Which sucked, but that\u2019s life sometimes. However, she always had time to hang out with her boyfriend like 2-3 days a week after they were both done working. Not gonna lie, part of me was super jealous that she had all the time in the world to hangout with him but didn\u2019t have time for me even tho we had tried to plan for a month or so at this point. But it\u2019s a new relationship, and I was there once. So I can understand the getting caught up and forgetting your friends for a while aspect of it. \n\nA bit of context, a few days prior to Mitchell and Everest getting together, I sent Everest a short clip of my weight loss progress. I was wearing a baggy t shirt and a pair of boxers. Everest texted me something like congrats. Flash-forward, Everest said Mitchell was feeling insecure, so Everest let him look through her phone. Mitchell saw the clip of me and accused Everest of cheating with me. When Everest told me that at first, I was like \u201cLMFAOOOO\u201d and then she was like \u201cno I\u2019m being serious right now\u201d. I had to defend myself saying I wasn\u2019t cheating with Everest. Which felt very dumb and I don\u2019t see why she couldn\u2019t say that to him herself, but eh. It\u2019s her first relationship and maybe she didn\u2019t know how to navigate things. That was end of that for now. \n\n Skip forward to the later portion of summer break, I text Everest basically saying I love her and I miss her, but I felt like our friendship has felt very one-sided lately. She apologized and said she would try to be better about reaching out to me and things have been very hectic because of work. For a couple days, we texted the usual amount (pre-relationship). Then silence again. She started to rarely respond to my texts, if at all. It would take her nearly a week to respond sometimes, but then I would see her all over Snapchat and TikTok. \n\nThe last message I had sent her up until this point was a screenshot of a TikTok she reposted that said \u201cwhen your friends don\u2019t like your boyfriend and your boyfriend doesn\u2019t like your friends\u201d. I asked \u201cis this about me? It\u2019s fine if it is, just wondering.\u201d She said it was about me and another co-worker, but everything was smoothing out. I told her I was sorry if I made her feel upset, and that talking about the whole rebound relationship stuff wasn\u2019t an attack on anyone\u2019s character if it came off that way. It was more of an observation. \n\nAfter feeling a little salty for a while, I decided, \u201cscrew it. I\u2019ll stop texting first and see how long it takes\u201d. 3 days, then a week, a week and a half, 2 weeks, a month, 2 months, and finally, 4 months. At this point, it\u2019s (currently) winter break. I was missing what we used to have and I messaged her saying \u201cHey I\u2019ve been missing you a little lately. Is there a reason we\u2019ve stopped talking?\u201d That was 10 days ago. No response. I thought I made it abundantly clear that telling her I thought she was probably in a rebound relationship was not an attack on anyone\u2019s character. \n\nPart of me is left feeling hurt that we haven\u2019t spoken in so long.

{"post": {"title": "Why do young women not break free from expectations these days?", "id": "1hnkvat", "created_utc": 1735322804.0, "selftext": "I read, see, and hear so many women complaining about how their men do nothing when it comes to laundry, hosting, cleaning, scheduling, kids, etc. Sometimes men say it will get done later or there's no need to stress just relax.\n\nWhy not take their lead? I know personally at first when I mentioned the idea my friends said yeah but then it won't get done. That's the point. Yes it's not easy, you feel guilty, especially when it comes to kids or hearing comments from your relatives or in-laws about why you didn't do something and your husband works harder (because no one understands women also work full time) but it's worth it.\n\nFor example my partner and I travel a lot both solo and together. He always packs 30 minutes before whether it's an overnight trip or a 3 month trek. He has forgotten underwear, shirts, socks, shaving, etc. His family makes comments it's my job to pack his suitcase. I work full time and he has flexibility with his work and will chill for hours leading up to his trip with plenty of time to pack. Not my job. He's never complained to me because he knows it's his job to pack. I've only helped him once and he didn't even ask I could see he was stressed and busy with work and no time to pack so of course I'll be supportive then.\n\nWhen his in laws visit I'd bust my ass cleaning and planning and he would say why are you stressing my parents won't care. All it took was one visit where I decided to take him up on that and he realized as his parents walked in the door that the house was a disaster and no plans were made. He was fielding comments from his parents. You bet now he's cleaning a few days before and discussing with me what we will be doing/eating before they get there now. \n\nLaundry? Super easy why do I stress. Every time I leave his for him to do he runs our of clothes as to rewear something, puts them in the wash,  forgets them for a few days and has to rewash to dry them and sometimes forgets again. Then he forgets they are in the dryer when it's time for his new outfit. He has never asked me to do laundry but I do his now and he gives me a big hug and kiss every time and says thank you because he knows remembering to take the load out and in, fold clothes, put away is a lot of work when we are already juggling the rest of our adult life errands lol.\n\n I always plan all the food for camping trips and was stressed. He told me it was simple and I was making a big deal I said okay you handle it. He was happy to show me. It was funny when we each got \u00bc of coffee for the entire weekend and our friends were irritated when they realized that's all he packed, a ration of one hotdog per person (no buns). Everyone complained and he was annoyed but I said hey he was in charge of food. Now he delegates to someone else.\n\nHe said kids are easy and didn't know why his sister was stressed with hers. I watched him take 30 minutes to buckle all three of them in the car this weekend and keep track of them for the day. I didn't lift a finger. You bet he looked at me at the end of the day and laughed saying okay. Nevermind. And that was a tear free,  no melt down day with them too. I can see things clicking in his head once he experiences the world through my eyes.\n\nLet things fall apart. Men will figure it out. They won't if you tell or show them. It all looks easy. Once they do it themselves they get it. And if your guy blames you for things falling apart or work delegated to him he didn't complete then he's not the one.\n\nAnd yes I still get comments from in-laws and parents but I don't care. No I'm not going to the kitchen with the other older women to wash dishes. I'll watch the game with you. I love that most women my age do this now and at parties it's the husband and wife that hosted are equally cleaning up in my age range.

I sent a Universe and a bunch of other expensive gifts to a creator who isn't small, but isn't big either. \n\nNow, for some background, I usually try to live below my means. I make a relatively good income (I have my own business), but it's nothing too crazy. I don't have any debt at all, so anything I make either gets reinvested into my business, or goes into passive investments and/or HYSA. I basically live (almost) the same lifestyle that I did 4 years ago when I was working at McDonalds, minus spending more going out with my girlfriend, and buying my family / friends gifts every now and then. It's not gonna end me wasting this much money, but it still stings.\n\nWhy did I send it? There's this creator I watch who plays interactive games / viewer vs streamer type of thing. Anyway, they actively encourages their top donators to go against each other on the basis of who can donate more. It's oddly thrilling, and gives me enough of a dopamine rush seeing them overreact / shout due to a donation to continue recharging and viewing their content. They'll actively provoke their top donators by calling them out, and I always take the bait whenever someone sends > 1000 coins or directly calls me out. I'm fully aware on what they're doing, but the thrill of \"outdoing\" the other person and seeing myself in the number 1 spot on the donation leaderboard is enough for my monkey brain to leave all logic out the window. I've gained a sort of \"high donor / top dog\" reputation (again, this isn't a big creator) so I always feel like I have to uphold that title whenever I watch them.\n\nToday, somebody who is a high donor in the stream called me out, and we faced off by donating money guns, galaxies, whales, and some other random gifts that we were sending just to outdo each other. At one point, they surpassed me in coins, and I simply loaded up on 46k coins and sent the universe. My opponent proclaimed defeat, and everyone in the chat was going crazy praising me along with the streamer. It felt incredible, and once it was all over, I felt like shit.  \n\nWhat bothers me most is probably the fact that at this point, it's making me vastly unproductive whenever I tune into their live. I'm usually at my computer all day, so tuning in takes basically no effort, an I've found myself checking every so often to see if they've gone live or not.  \n  \n Honestly I started off purchasing 100 coins a month ago out of curiosity when first \"discovering\" tiktok live. That escalated into a daily 2500 coin recharge, and I somehow ended up here casually spending $100 multiple times a day on tiktok coins. I feel like I'm too attached to the streamer and the platform at this point to stop tuning in completely, and it really irritates me. I physically feel sick right now like I just over indulged in a bunch of junk food. I know they wouldn't care about me anymore if I stopped donating, but part of me still thinks that all their praise, tags in their stores, and mentions about me are too much for me to just disappear. They have this permanent scoreboard that lists their all time donators, and I'm there in 1st place which means I'll always have something to return to until someone bigger comes along.

The only non-vanilla action allowed is /spawn in order to allow players who are very far out to not be isolated from civilization.\n\n\u2022 The only restrictions we have are that exploits, seed cracking/sharing, lag machines, duping, spamming and using harassment/racial slurs in chat are not allowed in order to maintain server stability.\n\n# FAQ:\n\n**1. Why do you have rules unlike 2b2t?**\n\nWhile a server with no rules might be suitable for some, not everyone enjoys an environment filled with spam, lag, and cheaters. This is why we have our four rules: Keep the chat civil, No exploits, No lagging, and No duping items.\n\n**2. If Anarchy Network is true anarchy, why can't I use cheats?**\n\nThis is a \"Semi-Anarchy\" server which means the server differs from pure Anarchy and we have some limitations in place. Cheats are third-party modifications to the game which ruin other players' experience; therefore, cheats are not allowed.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the server sounds interesting to you, here is our IP and discord server!\n\n**Server IP:** [AnarchyNetwork.net](http://AnarchyNetwork.net)\n\n**Discord Server:** [https://discord.gg/W7hRYgb2z9](https://discord.gg/W7hRYgb2z9)", "subreddit": "MinecraftServerFinder"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Here's a screenshot while playing GTA 5, you can see clearly 3 spikes downwards on the CPU (Processeur) and a bit on the GPU (Processeur Graphique). I now have 32gb of RAM, I had 16 in the screenshot :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fcwh0evifde1.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f41789600bbd62474f9cb5deb59c3020c1a9190\n\nHere's some of the things I have done:\n\n* Swapped rams and rams slots (including brand new ones)\n* Plugged my PSU directly in an outlet instead of an extension\n* Memtest86 - 0 erros\n* Seagate diagnostic tool for my hard drives - no erros\n* Updated my graphics card drivers\n* Updated all of my other drivers with Driver Booster 12 Pro\n* Virus scan with Malwarebytes - no threats\n* Cleaned up my files a bit\n* Watched CPU and GPU temperature while gaming - no worries\n\n  \nDoes the culprit seem to be my Power Supply? I have no other idea. I installed it brand new in July 2022. It is around 2.5 years old. Is there a way to test it easily?

{"post": {"title": "Anyone from any brazilian base here to share some experience?", "id": "1i31668", "created_utc": 1737066348.0, "selftext": "I did my DTS in 2020, at the Sem Fronteiras base in Curitiba, Paran\u00e1. Very complicated world period, with definitely odd circumstances, to say at least. I Also worked as a DTS staff for another six months and got out of that mess. Still have some conflicted feelings about everything that happened back then, but after reading several experiences here, I found a lot of similarities with my own, and finally plucked up the courage to expose it in some way.\n\nIt all started with a call from my cousin, saying that she had this dream that night that I was supposed to go to the vacation school at the base in Curitiba, which they call it MOVE, and, \u2018cuz of that dream, she had paid for the MOVE stuff and the bus ticket for me to go from my city in another state to Curitiba as a birthday gift, since I was about to complete 20.\n\nIt was all really weird. I had graduated from college that year, at the age of 19, much earlier than usual, and since my cousin had already paid for everything, I ended up going to the MOVE school, in January of 2020. I met some rlly nice and good people, the vacation school experience was okay to a certain point, but something always felt a bit off, especially when things had to do with me. Even so, I decided to stay for the DTS, since I\u2019d already been to uni, graduated, and didn\u2019t have a steady job, I thought it would be a constructive experience, but it all just turned out to be a pretty messed up nightmare.\n\nIdk if I need to dive into all the details of the general things that are already common knowledge here: brainwashing, alienation from the rest of the world and family, extremely poor infrastructure, food of very dubious provenance, ostracism, romanticizing poverty, discouragement from asking questions and, being honest, I **am** the questioning type, so at some point this began to bother the staff and the leaders a lot, not only of the DTS, but of the FCM too.\n\nI\u2019m autistic and, at the time, I still didn\u2019t had a clear diagnosis, but it was always clear that something __did__ made me way different than the other ppl there. And this specific difference, and they\u2019re realization of it, made them put me in charge of some stuff that were, to say at the very least, contradictory. While they told everyone at the meetings that the \u201cheavy work\u201d \u2014 such as leveling the ground, carry heavy stuff (like sofas), grouting floors, hauling debris, wash the huge pans, among other things \u2014 were for \u201cthe guys\u201d, \u201ccuz they\u2019re stronger\u201d, they put me to do the heavy work with the boys, even though I\u2019m a woman who doesn\u2019t even weigh 50kg.\n\nMost of the time, I had to hoe the ground with a tool taller than me. They casually treated me as if I were mentally deficient and incapable of understanding anything they were saying or explaining, even when I asked **really** good questions they couldn\u2019t manage to answer, invaded my privacy countless times, monitored my social media, and held multiple meetings to discuss and punish me often over something as minor as sharing a meme I found funny.\n\nThroughout the entire year I spent there, from MOVE to becoming a staff and \u201cleading\u201d an outreach team, they explicitly treated me differently. They dictated what clothes I could or couldn\u2019t buy (cuz they didn\u2019t allowed me to use the clothes I had, cuz \u201cthey\u2019re too much masculine\u201d), forbade me from cutting my hair, didn\u2019t allow me to participate in staff training sessions, leadership activities, or anything that was essential for those being trained as staff, and that every single staff trainee\u2019s participated.\n\nWith the pandemic and lockdown, many of these issues became even more intense. They had a huge problem with the fact that I need to spend much more time alone than most people. Cuz of that, they wouldn\u2019t allow me to have that time to regulate myself, always sending someone to monitor me, and I ended up having a lot of meltdowns, which then became the subject of lots of meetings to complain about my \u201cbad behavior\u201d. They prohibited me from getting close to certain people, among many other things that, when I look back on it, seem like a lot of them remain kinda hazy in my mind.\n\nSure, I had some cool experiences and meet a few nice people, but don\u2019t know if it was worth it. Sometimes, I think about pretending that year of my life never happened \u2014 that it was a lost year \u2014 and that I could\u2019ve spent that time doing something that would\u2019ve caused me fewer problems\u2026", "subreddit": "exywam"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

To get me away from the toxic environment/relationship they offered to let me stay with them. Now mind you I was working taking them wherever plus doing house work. I was the only one doing house work. It was his mom, his brother, him and his grandmother. Early last year him and I was offered a family house for us to move into to have our own life but as luck would have it the one paying bills at the apartment pasted away. By June his mom and brother was looking at being homeless so we decided that they could come with us to the house. At first his mom went to his aunts so only his brother came but eventually she got kicked out of the aunts place and is now sleeping in our living room. Now I do not work.  I have severe health issues ,on oxygen, and am working to get disability but nothing is wrong with his mom nor his brother but my fianc\u00e9e is the only one who is bringing income in. We told them they needed to get jobs and find a place but that has been over a year now and neither has tried to get a job. I have been raising heck about either us leaving or them.

I met them 8 years ago. At that time Ren and Adam were living in the basement of a house where the owner, a Deacon in the church, let them be there for next to nothing.\n\nHe also allowed them to care for friends struggling through homelessness. This included being okay with tents and several small shelters being built in the backyard and folks living in their cars parked along the street. All of these people were receiving simple services provided by Adam and Ren. In those early days, everyone knew it was only a matter of time before the city of Vancouver, WA would shut it down.  \n  \nTheir story is one of against-all-odds success, which now has them running their own nonprofit employing 42 people, all providing necessary services to those in need. Having said that, here is the earthshakingly beautiful part, are you ready?!  Every single one of their 42 employees was formerly homeless!  \n\nHow beautiful is that?! AND how are they doing this!?!\n\nIn the simplest of terms, they are putting relationship and connection first, leading with compassion, understanding, and patience. They truly see the value in every person and work to bring it to the forefront. There is clarity in the rules and boundaries, along with a deep understanding of how to navigate difficult moments that comes with a population often traumatized.\n\nWhere does that understanding come from, you might ask? Adam and Ren will tell you it comes from being in relationship, being close enough to know and feel the nuances. They see no differences or separation between those being served and those providing services. \n\nThat is peer support. For Ren and Adam, that is family. \n\n**Excerpt from the episode**  \n*So, if we're speaking to folks that homelessness doesn't touch their lives very often, if, but briefly,\u00a0 I would want to encourage people to really educate themselves about the problem nationwide, not just in their city, but really look at the increase from 500, 000 to probably 750, 000 just in the last couple years, that it happens in the richest places more than in the poorer places\u2026* \n\n*Secondly, the stigma, the rhetoric is only going to get worse when it comes to saying that folks are just, they're just doing drugs, they're just doing this, they're just doing that\u2026*\n\n*The fentanyl epidemic is affecting us as homeless folks, is affecting us drastically. But the fastest growing populations are youth and folks on social security\u2026*\n\n*People don't spend enough time on their sidewalks. Folks don't spend enough time walking. Folks don't spend enough time outside, but they sure have a lot to say about it.\u00a0 You know, I've walked all the sidewalks, and I, I know, and I know who walks the sidewalks, and it's, it's far and few between. It's the people in cars with their five seconds of judgment going by. So, if you really want to know, immerse yourself with an organization that allows people to come to the organization and, and meet folks, and, and go serve somewhere, go volunteer somewhere, go really educate yourself about who are We,\u00a0 and you know, take a walk or take a walk with someone who knows.*\n\n*Go say hello.  It all starts with just really humanizing people and realizing that homeless, homelessness is not a problem. These are humans that are experiencing homelessness that really need to be acknowledged.*\u00a0 \n\n*When I became homeless, I immediately became other people's judgment. When nothing had really changed about all the qualities that I had. Prior to me becoming homelessness. I was an experienced restaurant manager.  I had been married. I had all these things that I could speak of. But once I became homeless, I was that homeless guy. I was that dirty guy. I was that guy in the dumpster over there. And you know, no I wasn't. I was still Adam with all those same qualities. But I had to live outside because of the circumstances that happen.* \n\n*Primarily, most of the time, the circumstances are economic. You know, it's economic situations. Divorce, raising rents, an accident. For me, it was a combination of three things. And then depression on top of that. Because I can't believe I have to live outside. I can't believe I'm sleeping under a bush. You know, the, just, you know, who wouldn't? Be immediately, you know, and morbidly depressed about your situation when you lose everything.*\u00a0\n\n*Every single person you can't walk in any door without being looked at, you know. In my time of coming up homeless now, I hope and pray that like a lot of the work that we did over the last 10 years has really helped to change Vancouver's culture that allows for that camping that you see today, because 14, 10 years ago, there was no camping allowed anywhere and police would immediately arrest you if you put up a tent.  So maybe we had an influence on that and I like to think, and maybe this has an influence on other people that they're really going to go out there and just realize we. are no different than you. We are just people that circumstances happen to. And that we have to recover from that.*\n\n*And help others.* ***- ADAM***", "subreddit": "YouKnowMeNowPod"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I'm beside myself, they made a partial recovery and I honestly thought we'd have a turbulent relationship but grow old together. I know how stupid that sounds.\n\nWe both came together when we were in a lot of pain, and we have struggled with substance issues but always made it work. I pulled away somewhat after I got PTSD (unrelated reason, worsened by their aggression) and a quite ugly cycle of abuse and cheating happened. I'm not superhuman. I can't tell someone they love me after they split on me for the millionth time. I worked longer hours than I should have, but I thought it was for our future. They took it personally, there were frequent tantrums that I just wasn't able to soothe anymore because I was so drained. They think I'm not the same person - and it's true - I'm not exactly the same, but people change. I don't want to be out doing drugs every weekend. I'm just unable to make it work anymore because I don't feel like they know how an adult relationship works. After 9 years, it can't just be chemical attraction, both people have to make it work - they have this expectation and I just can't shore it up anymore.\n\nI know that I have to go because I can't fight for someone who cheats on me and manipulates me. I can't fight for someone who isn't willing to work on a lack of object constancy (ie. seeing me as a person through a lens of a long period of time) and just says, \"fuck 9 years, I know how I feel now.\" I would have crossed any ocean for them, but they're not even willing to let them into their heart anymore. I'm painted black for a final time, and I'm not going to sacrifice my soul and self-worth for a tin of white paint.\n\nI haven't spoken to her in person for more than 2 weeks. I can't just cut and go because we're married. I know they're no good for me, I know they can't be an adult with me. Some days I whistle and know I'll be ok, even if they're in our marital home pitying themselves, while I live in an unfamiliar place and rebuild my future. Other days I wake up howling in pain, full of regret for the years wasted, and even at times seeking consolation from my abuser.\n\nAnd yet, I don't pick up the phone and play the game.

{"post": {"title": "PJs feats during S4E21", "id": "1i315yo", "created_utc": 1737066333.0, "selftext": "Sooo like I made this during a debate but ig this can go here too.\n\nSo for some context/info necessary: A pizza delivery guy found a burned corpse handcuffed to a car and the police connected the body to a certain Archie Bloom. Cans of gasoline were also found. They realized this dude was gay and faced many issues as a result of it. \n\nThey found a heel and connected it to a nearby drag show the heel was connected to a certain Glennda, who claimed that they saw a man watching them and high-tailed it. \n\nThe car was registered to Archie which is how they found him and it was confirmed through dental records. The gas cans came from a store Archie worked at, the father was clearly ashamed of his son. Which Jane reasoned because of the fact that Archie Sr. named his son after himself, so he was probably hoping for an heir yet there is not one image of his son in the house.\n\nHis father and Rick Hughes both become people of interest. Rick Hughes is Archie's coworker from the store and constantly picked on him, Rick is a homophones and added all sorts of feminine decorations to Archie's locker which Archie simply braved.\n\n There was a video found of Archie's father handcuffing him to a chair to do his homework saying it might \u201ctoughen him up\u201d its worth noting the handcuffs were similar to those found at the crime scene handcuffing the body to the car with some partial prints belonging to the father. \n\nThey then asked around with a bookstore owner who rented Archie a room. Hughes has motive aside from simply being a bully in that Archie took some pictures of him hustling some baby formula from the store which is occasionally used for drugs also it doesn't help that the fellas in the image did NOT look friendly. \n\nHe then comes meet Glennda at his day job as a funeral cosmetologist In order to ask about his lie realizing he cold read Glennda wrong because he read him as a man instead of a woman. \n\nA little bit of an EP feat, he profiled that Rick Hughes\u2019 emotions stemmed from weakness hence why he was emotionally immature (started yelling) and aggressively masculine (homophobic and called the victim a little princess) he inferred there was some childhood humiliation involved.\n\nThey then find somewhere he stayed for a bit and they find someone and realized the bookstore guy and Archie were lovers in a bit of an abusive something or other. \n\nThere is also a journal with details regarding bookstore dude stating that the fella kept meth in his jacket which he does, so again another suspect. \n\nHe takes note of one of the drag ladies working as a dentist for his day job which mind you is a detail that could very easily slip past him. \n\nSo this is how he resolved the case. (Reasoning part)\n\nJane recognizes that there are three neatly packaged possibilities, at this point his deductive prowess had already arrived at the correct conclusion all he had to do was close it. \n\nHe convinced Glennda to pick someone out of a lineup by saying that she values people who are different and that Archie was burned alive because he was different, he knows it would look very bad if she refused given the information that Glennda already knows (and will be revealed later) when Glennda said that none of them were there it confirmed his suspicions.\n\n\nGlennda said that all of the people were too big and that the man that she saw was slender, she also said the father looked familiar. The reason the father looked familiar and the man was more slender which makes sense as the man she saw was Archie Bloom himself.\n\nAll three of the men there hurt Archie in some way\nBookstore guy abused him sexually and violently while on substances\nThe father rejected his own son and was ashamed of him\nThe coworker bullied him, called him names, gave him stuff like aprons and stuffed animals and put stickers on his locker\n\nAt this point it would make sense for Jane to assume that any one of these three is the killer, they all fit perfectly, however he sees through this to the correct answer.\n\nFrom all the information previously provided he inferred that Archie Bloom lit himself on fire after handcuffing himself even further supported by the fact the handcuffs were his own father's and he left clues to make each one a suspect. \n\nHe left clues to make each individual a suspect, practically Russian roulette for who would get the murder pinned on them, and in the process expose them for other crimes even if the scheme was revealed they would all be prosecuted for separate infractions of the law.\n\nThe evidence went as follows, the handcuffs for the father, the journal for the bookstore guy, and the gas can from the store with the bullies fingerprints. \n\nHe then noted the choice of a drag alley for his place to kill himself, he remembered the girls there and one stood out.\n\nFifi Nix was the name of the one who stood out, this turns into phoenix, pheonix -> risen from the ashes -> fire, this connects with rhe fact Archie Bloom \u201cdied\u201d by fire. So Fifi Nix is Archie Bloom and he faked his death\n\nHe then realized Archie was talked out of suicide by Glennda since everybody there considered her as a mentor figure helping them so they staged a suicide.\n\nGlenn worked at a cemetery for his day job after all he had access to a body and Fritta there was a dentist after all and the way they \u201cidentified\u201d the body was through dental records.\n\nThe dentist even explains how Archie met this drag group. It is explained that Archie met the group through noticing some eyeliner on his dentist. \n\nThis also explains why Glennda lied. He knew that Archie was alive all along because his recent actions matched the profile of someone who wanted to live, not preparing to die.\n\nHe doesn't explain what clues lead to this but they are scattered throughout the episode. Archie's coworker said that Archie said that he got used to bullying throughout his old job and Archie's counselor said that Archie was planning to stand up against his abuse from the bookstore guy.", "subreddit": "IntelligenceScaling"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

My dogs are 2 and 3 and are fairly well trained, they both did puppy preschool and I spent a lot of time training them early on. \n\nThere's a few issues that I could never fix though like pulling on the lead during walks, one of my girls Ellie always barks at other dogs during our walks as well, which is a bit embarrassing for me even though she probably thinks she's just protecting us haha. Both of my girls love to swarm me when I get home from work as well which I love. Whenever I have guests over though they get excited and jump all over them which I've been trying to fix because I don't like leaving them outside or in my room by themselves when people are over.\n\nLong story short though, I finally bit the bullet and took Doggy Dan up on one of his ads. It included every program he's created in one package. I'd name them but if you've seen the ads, there's a lot. In the app that you get access to there are hundreds of videos on practically every issue imaginable. The thing that pushed me over the edge though was the fact that you can send in videos of your dogs and the specific issue that you're trying to fix and Dan works with you 1 on 1 to solve it.\n\nIt's only $1 to try it out and it's well worth it if you ask me. Just sharing this in case you're getting the same ads on Facebook. It's definitely cheaper to get all the programs in one app rather than buying them individually. Plus the community you become a part of is awesome, I love seeing the progress videos.\n\nDelete this if it isn't allowed but I thought it'd be helpful for any dog parents who just adopted or if you're having issues. If I got another pup today I'd definitely just use the training programs in the app instead of spending $120 on puppy preschool. \n\nHere's a link if you're interested - [https://theonlinedogtrainer.com/the-easy-way](https://theonlinedogtrainer.com/the-easy-way/?&shield=009750tdqebqitezxfmifzwm0z)", "subreddit": "grandjunction"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Recently, my employer informed me that they\u2019re considering ending my contract early in June 2025 due to a combination of financial constraints and what they\u2019ve described as my low productivity.  \n\nWhile I understand their concerns, I\u2019m trying to figure out if they\u2019re legally allowed to terminate a fixed-term contract like mine for this reason. I\u2019ve read that fixed-term contracts are generally binding for their full duration unless there\u2019s a valid reason for early termination. However, I\u2019m unsure what qualifies as a valid reason under Czech labor law.  \n\nHere\u2019s some context:  \n\n\\- My position is partially funded by grants, but one of their recent grant applications was rejected, which they\u2019ve mentioned as part of the issue.  \n\n\\- They\u2019ve also suggested switching me to a part-time contract until December 2025 as an alternative.  \n\n\\- My contract does not explicitly mention performance-related clauses or funding contingencies.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d like to know:  \n\n1. Under Czech labor law, can low productivity be considered a valid reason for early termination of a fixed-term contract? What does low productivity even mean?\n\n2. Does a funding shortfall justify ending the contract early, even if this wasn\u2019t explicitly stated in the contract?  \n\n3. If I don\u2019t agree to the early termination or part-time arrangement, what are my rights?  \n\nI appreciate any insights, especially if you\u2019ve experienced something similar or are familiar with employment laws in the Czech Republic.

He was my Prince Charming.\n\nHis voice, his face, his gentlemanly manners, and his body\u2026 A lean, athletic, perfect body. He was a sportsman, and it showed in every part of him.\n\nHe was the most handsome guy I had ever met in my university life. And now, after three years together, I can proudly say we\u2019re still a couple.\n\nBut everything changed when he moved in with me and my parents. Charlie began neglecting his appearance. His once shiny, golden hair\u2014so soft to the touch\u2014became dry and filthy. His sparkling blue eyes, like diamonds, now looked hollow, surrounded by dark circles that made them seem like empty sockets.\n\nHis flawless, snow-white skin turned yellowish and pale, riddled with imperfections. And his smell\u2026 oh, his smell\u2026 It was unbearable, like something rotting.\n\nEach day, things got worse. My parents noticed it, too, but I reassured them it was just a rough patch, maybe depression from leaving his home. I truly believed we could fix things.\n\nI was so naive.\n\nWhen I tried to get close to him one night, seeking intimacy, I noticed something that made my skin crawl. White maggots fell to the floor as I helped him take off his shirt. Then I saw it\u2014his body, the body I had once adored, was full of holes, cavities where insects crawled freely. His skin oozed fluids, dripping from his decaying flesh.\n\nI cried. I cried harder than I ever had, confronted with the reality of what had become of Charlie and our relationship. Through my sobs, I screamed:\n\n\u201cWhy, Charlie? Why did you let yourself go? Is it because you don\u2019t love me anymore?\u201d\n\nBut there was no response. Charlie just lay on my bed, silent, unmoving, not even looking at me.\n\nMy cries woke my parents. They entered my room and found me in tears. I told them Charlie didn\u2019t love me anymore, that something had changed. And, like they always do when boys no longer want to stay with me, they took care of it.\n\nWithout a word, they carried Charlie to the car, loaded him into the trunk, and drove to the nearby woods. I stayed on the couch, sobbing, waiting for them to return.\n\nWhen they came back the next morning, my father gave me a look of pity before heading upstairs to put on his sheriff\u2019s uniform. My mother sat beside me, wrapping me in her arms.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just how boys are, sweetheart. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll meet your real Prince Charming soon,\u201d she whispered gently.\n\nLater, my father came downstairs, fully dressed for work.

I'm writing all of my gripes first, so all criticism is going to be front loaded.\n\nTldr: cool glasses, there should be a preference setting for auto brightness that adds +5% and +10% to whatever the auto brightness thinks it should be (normal, bright and brighter buttons), teleprompter bugs out and will not recognize any speech AT ALL when stopping and then restarting a script (this is why I bought the glasses and will 100% ruin them for me if not fixed), they should point out how to customize for your eyes in the setup guide, ai responses are super long.  All that said, the tech is cool and I think the company has been great so far, even if they didn't give me info on my late package, they always responded kindly and within 12 hours to every one of my emails. I look forward to fiddling with this more in the future. \n\n\n\nUnboxing was awesome. Glasses and case both came with a 70% charge give or take. Pairing and setup was smooth and I jumped in immediately to the main reason I bought the glasses, the teleprompter. \n\nUsing the included test example, I was super surprised with how natural it all felt to use... however I quickly became upset with the blur of the text and the hight at which the teleprompter was displaying the text. \n\nIt took me about an hour to actually find the eye width and height adjustments, and was slightly annoyed that there wasn't any other mention of them during setup... maybe I just missed them, whatever. Then, shortly after, I loaded my own script into the glasses for a real test, about 12 pages long, with some repetition, and something I had already memorized the majority of. \n\nWorks almost perfectly! Hooray! 600$ not wasted! I got to change something in the script to Tweak it... it's a bit of a pain because I have to scroll a million times instead of it just allowing me to edit from where i left off speaking, but I do it. I hit play again and.... it doesn't recognize my voice. \n\nOkay... weird... let's try again... okay... same issue. Maybe a glitch? Lets restart then. Restarting doesn't work either... huh\n.. this'll be a problem if its not just a one off issue.. restart AND disconnect? Okay... re-pair the glasses... poof! It works again! \n\nOkay.. let's practice the script one more time... fast forward an hour later... done. Try to start it up again from the beginning? Oof... same issue. \n\nThis now happens anytime I want to use the teleprompter. I never know if it's going to work the first time I start it... and if it does, I scroll up, try to start over again from the beginning when it's time to ACTUALLY read my script in front of a class or customers... and then it stops working. So I'm left winging the parts I forget or missing sections about 50% of the time when the system stops working. \n\nMaybe it's because my script is so long? I'm not sure. But it's the main reason I bought the glasses and it's frustrating. In addition, the auto brightness setting is always just a LITTLE lower than it should be for the ambient light imo, it's almost never 'just right'. \n", "subreddit": "EvenRealities"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

For context, my mom died when I was a teenager and he remarried a year later after our family was against it. Me and my siblings have had a strained relationship with him ever since. Over the years we have learned to put up with it because he was happy and I quickly learned his happiness meant more than mine. He never talked about my mom or anything like that after she died and just pretended she didn't exist. Now, it has been almost 8 years since he's been married and he chooses to have a child. I am the youngest and I'm graduating college in a couple months. His baby is due on my graduation day. He was a very absent father as is and my mother raised me and my siblings for the most part. He also did NOT tell me about this pregnancy or that it was even an idea. In fact, one of the things he told me when he remarried was that his second wife was infertile and could not have children so we wouldn't have to worry about him having more kids. Turns out, they've been secretly doing IVF and got pregnant (he's denying this but I saw the paperwork). He is goin to be in his 70s when the baby graduates high school. This is insane. My oldest sibling is 33, more than old enough to be this kid's parent. My father barely parented us as kids and now he thinks he's going to parent this one with ease. His wife has also never been a mother and she knows nothing. On top of all this, my dad is an alcoholic. I told him he needs to stop drinking if he's going to have a child and he said that would never happen. I went off on him today (I found out about this yesterday because I saw my stepmother for the first time in forever and she looks visibly pregnant) because he hid this from me for almost 6 months. He wasn't going to tell me about it until the baby was BORN. I told him he is so irresponsible and that I feel bad for this baby because \"I wouldn't wish you as a father on my worst enemy.\" This felt very harsh but I was SO angry. And I still am. But he needed to hear it. I told him that his actions are embarrassing as it makes our entire family look bad in the eyes of our church community, especially when his oldest child his currently trying to have a child as well. This kid is going to be the same age as its niece or nephew. What on earth??? I am still in shock from this news obviously but I do feel guilty about getting angry and cussing my dad out. I said some mean things and then he threatened to off himself (which he has done many times), to which I said \"You don't get to choose the easy way out anymore, you gotta raise this innocent child for the next 18 years now.\" As someone who lost my mom young it is hard to watch him put another child through that willingly. His health is not good and I don't even know if he will live to see the kid turn 18. This whole situation is just fucked and horrible. On top of all this, he expects me to help out with the baby when it's born because I currently am living in the basement of his house right now. He's derailing my life and plans to move out and be on my own by making me feel guilty for leaving this child with him now. The whole situation is just selfish and insane.

I have pain in the center of my lumbar spine (when I point to it my husband said it\u2019s where my incision is) and it goes out to the left, wrapping around my leg.  It got very painful last week and I was having trouble getting into a seat, or getting out of a seat but sitting or laying the pain is much better.\n\nI have altered sensation across my knee that comes and goes (but is more present than not) and I can feel it on the inside of my right knee.  I have tingling on the inside of my left leg, above my ankle.  I tested my toe dorsiflexion and it\u2019s weaker on the left but not non existent.  I also have a weird sort of pulling aching in the dermatome going from the outside of the leg across the knee to the ankle on the left leg.  A little bit of tingling on my left thigh as well.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing heat and ice alternating in the afternoon and evenings after work, and I think that is helping the pain, I seem to be getting less shooting into my thigh from the back, as well as the pain in my back is reduced.  I\u2019m also taking gabapentin 300mg in the evening, I cannot take it during the day it makes me too dopey.\n\nAnyway, I had a pain management appt Monday and she sent me back to my surgeon who I see next Wednesday.

It is typically caused by external factors beyond our control, prompting the need to regroup and consider alternative plans. Setbacks can range from minor inconveniences, like a rainy day foiling your hiking plans, to more significant challenges, like contracting COVID-19 and missing a week of work. Regardless of the severity, setbacks are undesirable and tend to dampen our mood.\n\nWhen confronted with a setback, we always have choices regarding how to proceed. On the one hand, we can choose to keep a positive attitude and explore available options. Alternatively, we can give in to negativity and sulk until we feel ready to move on. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that sometimes it\u2019s okay to grieve for a while\u2014many setbacks in life are genuinely painful, and we need time to process.\n\nHowever, in most cases, rather than seeing setbacks as losses or failures, we can reframe them as potential opportunities. Missing a hike due to rain may result in a delightful day of family board games. Missing a week of work due to COVID-19 may provide some much-needed rest, while allowing time for self-reflection and reshuffling of life\u2019s priorities.\n\nThe world is constantly evolving, and so are we. Setbacks are an inevitable part of that change, so it\u2019s crucial to learn how to deal with them in a positive and constructive way. The more flexible and adaptable we are, the more likely we can transform setbacks into new opportunities. Failure to adapt in the face of change only results in being left behind.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nSetbacks were what led me to some of the best parts of my life today. My online jobs, my husband, and our housesitting business have all originated from initial setbacks: COVID-19, a missing passport stamp, and a visitor visa that felt like it would never arrive. Sometimes, detours lead to better destinations.\n\nTo read more about these stories and how you can turn setbacks into opportunities, grab your copy of \u201c30 Lessons I Learned Before 30\u201d on your local Amazon! \ud83d\udcd6 \n\n(All book sale profits are going to schools in Mozambique and Malawi.)", "subreddit": "GetMotivated"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

(37f/32m)\n\nI have no idea how to fix my relationship. My wife and I act more like roommates than husband and wife. It depresses the hell out of me and I know it\u2019s entirely my fault. \n\nMy wife (37f) and I (32m) have been married for just over seven years; been together 10 in total. We have a kid (6f) together as well. Our life together was great for a while but it gradually got worse largely because of my own actions (or rather inactions). \n\nWhen our daughter was born, that was probably the first appearance of trouble. I was frustrated because she seemed cold and distant; she was frustrated because I wasn\u2019t pulling my weight around the house. Neither of these problems were resolved; if anything, she got more distant and I got more obtuse. I was so caught up in my own mental and physical health issues that I couldn\u2019t see how she was drowning between work, the house, and our daughter. \n\nI convinced myself I was doing better because I\u2019d occasionally remember to do chores, but much much more often I would forget. Meanwhile she was left to do all these tasks. \n\nThe one thing I have always prided myself in is I do a good job of being an equal parent to our daughter, but aside from that I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any single other thing I do well that benefits our partnership. I didn\u2019t make money, as I had a media company I was trying (and failing) to build up. I didn\u2019t help at home either because I grew up with parents who would gladly just let the house go to shit. I somehow didn\u2019t think anything of it until it became an issue. \n\nThings got even worse when COVID hit. I had a mental breakdown, a rather extended one wherein she threatened to institutionalize me a few times. It made her even more distant, and again made me grow even less helpful if that\u2019s possible. \n\nSince then it\u2019s been a parade of rough times. A miscarriage, her sister dying, me pursuing a new profession to try to at least be financially useful. All this time I still didn\u2019t seem to get how bad things were becoming. That is until we had a big blowup fight about two years ago. \n\nShe said I had been taking advantage of her kindness and her accepting nature, and that through my unwillingness to meet her halfway I had hurt her more than I could understand. She more or less told me that until things changed, she was shutting down for her own sake. And true to her word, since then she barely has real conversations with me, we have no intimacy, she doesn\u2019t even really seem to like me. I don\u2019t blame her tbh. \n\nNow that I\u2019m out of school and seeing things a bit more clearly, I see it all. I see how miserable I\u2019ve made her. I see how oblivious I\u2019ve been to everything. I see how she looks at me now, and I think back to how she used to look at me and it makes me want to just sit and cry for hours at a time. But I don\u2019t even know where to begin in fixing things. I\u2019m trying hard to be an equal partner in all respects. She says real change doesn\u2019t happen overnight and that I\u2019ve done this before for brief periods then sunk back into old habits. I don\u2019t disagree. I just don\u2019t know how to keep going and how to fix this when I just feel so lonely and defeated. And then I remember that\u2019s how Ive made her feel and it gets that much worse. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for rambling. Idk if any of this even makes sense.

My friend is the same age as me.\n\nWe all each other sister in law, because my brother in law is insisting on marrying her soon and they're serious about their relationship. \n\nThis is why I think she's avoiding me:\n\nA few months ago she was fired from her job due to an asshole manager that didn't like her. She worked very hard for the job. She got sick with covid, so he terminated her. She fell onto some hard times and I told her to ask me if she needed help financially. She told me she didn't feel right asking that, but I insisted. I loaned her $450. My brother in law paid her rent for her and whatever else she needed. \n\nShe insisted on paying me back when I didn't consider it as a requirement because I love and care for her. So I told her fine. I told her she could pay me back when she was stable with all her necessities, I even told her to get her hair and nails done to feel good about herself since she was going through such a hard time. \n\nFrom time to time she would tell me the dates she would pay me back. Then it would change. The dates to pay me back changed about 3-4 times. She told me how bad she felt because she also wanted to help my brother in law out with his finances and she felt like she needed to pay him back for him paying her rent. \n\nAfter a while, to be honest, I was annoyed. I was annoyed because it was \"I'll pay you back this day!\" Then, \"I can't pay you back because I want to help Zach.\" Then, \"I'm hanging out with (someone), but I still want to pay you back.\" I reiterated to her to chill out and just pay back when you can, stop telling me when you will, then you change your mind again. \n\nMy husband became upset because I needed to buy money for my medications and money became tight with us, but I wasn't worried because I stocked up the house with things we needed. But he was anxious for me because I've had a rough health history of me being in the hospital a few times. Our marriage has been very rocky and stressful. \n\nSo ny husband called his brother and told him about the money issue with my friend/sister in law. He pushed it back onto us and told us that whatever money she borrowed from my husband and I, needed to be sorted between us and not him included which pissed me off because he says he's going to marry her, but keeps her at arms length a lot. She treats him like a husband, but he treats her still like a girlfriend sometimes, idk. \n\nSo my brother in law told her to pay us back in full and stop going all over the place. I found this strange because she would tell me she wanted to help my brother in law out and pay him back, then my brother in law would tell my husband that he didn't need help financially and he was good, but then a week later he borrowed money from us to pay his phone bill. \n\nShortly after this while I was in the car on my way home with my husband, he was on the phone with his brother watching him gamble online. My friend/sister-in law hates it and doesn't like that my brother in law gambles. She thinks he does it too much. So he gave her his account info to see if he gambles, and the only time he can gamble is with her permission. That night he was gambling and my husband was watching I thought, \"Did he ask her to gamble?\" So that night on the phone while I talked to her, I told her that he won some money online. She was furious and hurried off the phone with me. I rushed to tell my husband what happened while he was on the phone with my brother in law and he said \"THANKS BRO!\" Which i knew was directed towards me. She blew his phone up. He then lied to her saying he wasn't gambling when that night he used my husband's account to gamble. \n\nShe came back to me and said how honest he was and how he didn't lie to her while looking her in the eyes, when my husband and I both knew he was gambling and lying to her. \n\nEver since this incident, she really hasn't spoken to me. She would send a text to me here and there, but usually she would call me everyday. She's stopped doing that. \n\nDo you think she's avoiding me? Do you think my brother in law got in her ear and told her how he didn't like me stirring up things? Which i didn't, i just told her what I saw, I didn't think he was going behind her back.\n\nBut I just feel like our relationship is different now and is fading some.

These are my thoughts, you may or may not agree.  As fellow SD's, it's good to know some \"Best Practices\" as to what we can and can't do or shouldn't do.  It seems some repeated items come up often.  Typically around the M&G, Allowances, and upfront money.  I posted this someplace else and thought I'd post it for my new found friends here at SD hangout.  \n\nI'm also sure that any SB's that hit this site will want to argue me down and claim I'm a cheap ass bastard (a label I proudly wear by the way).  But the fact is, I'm pretty wealthy in my own right, having sold an Oil & Gas company a few years ago.  But I've also learned that just because someone has money doesn't mean that you have to throw it away either.  \n\n  \nSo below are my \"best practices\" for Sugaring.  \n\n  \nWhile we all get burned from time to time (I had a SB that I saw on a regular basis steal a watch from me. Fortunately, it wasn't very expensive). The fact is, we need to hold to some basic best practices that for some reason some guys think don't apply to them.  \n  \n1. NO MONEY UP FRONT! Just don't. If an SB says she needs uber, gas, a new tire, just don't. Pass and move on. On one hand,  you'll be out some money and come on here and tells us how stupid you were for getting ripped off. On the other hand, she found a sucker who'll cover all of her costs and get you for all the money your worth. you'll be forever the mark, having to cover all of her unexpected expenses and cover all of her poor life choices. If you are going to do that, just get married. \n\nRemember, for every SB that asked for money up front, there's dozens of others that are glad to meet you for free. Pass and move on.  \n  \n2. NO MONEY at the M&G. I still haven't figured this one out. Why guys think they need to pay for a M&G. You must really be ugly if you got to pay a girl to even meet with you over coffee or dinner. <SMH>. Never pay for a M&G. I'm not saying to be a selfish pig, I've met a few girls and after the M&G, I gave them a token $20/$40 bucks for a babysitter or some gas money. But I've never paid for a M&G nor have I given an allowance up front. Now once the arrangements have started, that's a different story, especially for my long term SB's. I might come across as the hero and pay an allowance when I don't have time for the sex, but I've only done that with a very long term SB (going on 4 years now).\u00a0Once you're in an arrangement, rent assistance, help with school, etc. is all part of the game.  But not at the M&G.    \n  \nIf a girl wants money at a M&G, just pass. There's no chick hot enough to warrant money at a M&G. I always consider a M&G just like a job interview. How many of us have been paid to go on a job interview? NONE. So why pay for a M&G? The downside is once you do it, then I can guarantee you the next POT SD ends up hearing \"Well my last SD paid me to just look pretty and eat dinner with him, no sex\". it poisons the well. You WILL get ripped off and you WON'T get laid. Just don't do it.  \n  \n  \n3 KEEP TO A SMALLER ALLOWANCE.   True, my old pre-covid allowance of $200 for vanilla or $300 for greek might need to come up a little due to inflation, but $500/$600 or even thousands of dollars for a PPM is ridiculous unless your Elon Musk wealthy and you need them to sign a NDA. Today, I'm successful with holding to a $300 allowance that many times includes greek. I can hit up an AMP, a LMT, etc., and get all I want for $300, no sense in paying more for a SB. Shucks, we all discovered that even rich and famous congressmen Matt Gaetz didn't pay more than $300. Why lose your reputation and potentially go to jail for thousands of dollars when you can save the difference to use for your lawyer fees later on? if you're a republican, be a good one and only spend $300 like Matt Gaetz. if you're a democrat or a independent, then be a good one and only spend $300 and you can donate the other $700 to some poor people for a trans operation.  \ud83d\ude02 (a little joke for everyone).  \n  \n  \nSeriously though, I learned the hard way, $1000 dollar pussy doesn't feel any better than $200 pussy. In fact, I had one SB who was a true published supermodel. I'm not going to out her, but you've probably jacked off to some of her pictures. She was so good looking that when we walked into the restaurant, both women and men turned to look at her. Guess what? She was the worst fuck I've ever had in my entire life, both vanilla and SB. Seriously, after that, I vowed to never throw that money away on someone like that again. I found if you want energetic, enthusiastic ball lickers, ass rimmers, anal loving greek queens, cum on face, fuck me however you can sugar babies, go for the 6 - 8's. My best fuck was a married spinner, about 100 lbs soaking wet, with what most guys would think would be a butter face (not ugly, but not strikingly beautiful either), who gladly let me fuck her in the ass, turn around and without any hesitation about what was on my dick, took me in her mouth and got my eyes to roll in the back of my head as she sucked and swallowed every last drop out of my dick. My \"10\" sports illustrated super model didn't do that.  \n  \nif I tried hard enough, I'm sure I could come up with the 10 commandments of sugaring, but I'm feeling lazy right now and don't want to write it all out. But those 3 best practices of sugaring will spare most guys the misery of getting rinsed or ripped off by any scammers. You'll also get all the hot sex you want for only $300 a PPM. But the secret is, you have to hold to that rate. For every SB out there who wants $10,000 a month allowance, there's dozen more who'll gladly lick your ass, suck your balls, and let you fuck her ass for $300 and love every minute of it. The trick? Be patient and hold your own (and your wallet). You can all thank me later.\u00a0\n\nAnd for every SB  out there who wanders in here and gets pissed off at this post and upset about it, well, there's 10 others lined up to take my money.    \n", "subreddit": "sugardaddyhangout"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

", "id": "1i30tq7", "created_utc": 1737065438.0, "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m reaching out to this community to share my story and seek advice from anyone who has dealt with chronic tonsillitis and opted for a tonsillectomy. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve been struggling with persistent throat issues that have left me feeling drained and frustrated.\n\nIt all started back in September when I developed a viral throat infection after a weekend of traveling. What began as white spots on my tonsils and throat soreness quickly turned into something much more prolonged. At first, urgent care testing showed no bacterial or strep infection, so I was advised it was viral and left to ride it out.\n\nBy October, my symptoms hadn\u2019t improved much. I had ongoing throat inflammation, recurring white tonsil spots, and significant fatigue. I went through more detailed testing, and a throat swab revealed the presence of Fusobacterium necrophorum, a bacterium known for causing throat infections. My doctor prescribed a 10-day course of clindamycin and metronidazole to treat it. While I hoped this would resolve the issue, my symptoms persisted after finishing the antibiotics.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been in what feels like a constant cycle. My throat remains sore and inflamed, my tonsils develop white spots that come and go, and I experience varying degrees of post-nasal drip, fatigue, and body aches.

She had an abscess located at her lower butt cheek, which was swollen and badly infected. In fact, she was burning up with a high fever. Even worse, for her, she was emotionally distraught over a stranger having taken Prince, her dog, her best friend.\n\nKaitlyn was at a serious low point. Her need for housing, drug rehab, and therapy, were unavailable, all deadends.\u00a0 She was slipping through the cracks. \n\nWhen people are in their moment of deep struggle, we all have difficulty in knowing how best to be of service. It can feel insurmountable. Each person in need has different barriers, with different complexities, and different abilities.  \n\nHowever, what is common to each person is the need for human connection. It begins there. And with this connection, the best path forward, one that often is hidden, begins to reveal itself. \n\nA small group of people formed a community and began to get to know Kaitlyn. From those friendships, a path forward for her emerged. \n\nThe idea, or act, of Mutual Aid has been around for a long time, for a very long time. Perhaps, in the simplest form, from the beginning of time. \n\nMutual Aid is nothing more than people coming together, in community, to take care of each other, often addressing basic needs and human rights that are not being met. \n\nThe barriers, or, the reason for needs not being met and/or rights not being afforded, are often systemic and political. The people who get involved in Mutual Aid are motivated by the injustices and want to take part in direct action. Which includes, providing services, advocating for needed systems change, and connections through friendship. \n\nIn the United States, we see Mutual Aid groups forming as early as the late 1700\u2019s, often by minority groups being oppressed. Today there has been a resurgence of participation in Mutual Aid. The Covid pandemic, Black Lives Matter, and homelessness are just a few examples illustrating that the societal systems used to serve us are not adequately meeting the needs of our community. For that reason, people are stepping forward to get involved. ", "subreddit": "YouKnowMeNowPod"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

My work includes corporate interviews, event coverage, drone shots, and photography\u2014handling everything from pre- to post-production as a one-man-band. While occasionally interesting, the work is never fulfilling. There's also no upward mobilityas my role is a one and done for the college\n\nSince 2016, my salary hasn\u2019t kept pace. I shoot and edit 60-70 videos a year, earning $60k. That averages under $1,000 per video for multi-cam shoots with full lighting and audio and editing projects ranging from 2-minute brand videos to 20-minute mini-docs. Besides a 1.5% YoY increase, I\u2019ve only gotten a single raise in my 8 years despite quadrupling my output for the college, and that raise was framed as \u201cthe only raise you're gonna get\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m ready for something bigger and hopefully better. However, the path forward feels uncertain and financially unstable.\n\nThe narrative/IATSE path seems like a pipe dream for recent college grads willing to sacrifice all of their 20\u2019s being underpaid and overworked before they find stability. The work-life balance is notoriously awful, and would require me to effectively restart my career from the bottom up as a PA for (probably less than) half my current salary. For someone in their 30\u2019s trying to supporting a family, this doesn\u2019t seem feasible to me. It also requires you to physically live in near LA (hyper saturated and insanely expensive) or another major production hub like NYC, Chicago, ATL, etc. (still saturated and fairly expensive). And in the current post-covid/post-strike environment, even 15-year industry vets are having difficulty securing work.\n\nThe commercial filmmaking path seems more stable, but the small college town I work in doesn\u2019t exactly have a thriving production scene with freelance opportunities. The few productions that do happen are with fully staffed out-of-town (or entirely out-of-state) crews popping in for a day and then leaving. I PA\u2019d a couple of times on these sets, and while the crews were kind and receptive, nothing reoccurring has come from those relationships.\n\nPlus, the boogeyman of generative AI is likely to target those mid-tier budgeted commercials first, making that path feel risky in the long term.\n\nThis puts me into a position where if I want any evolution in my career, I have to make it myself. I\u2019ve already made an LLC a few years ago to pick up some infrequent side work for local creative agencies doing brand videos for their clients, but these are still the one-man-band productions that rely on me doing everything. It\u2019s just as taxing as my current in-house gig (which I still work at full-time), but at least I can triple my pay per project.\n\nHowever, this kind of work would never allow me to specialize into any one thing (like a gaffer, an AC, a DoP, a colorist, a director, etc.) because it prioritizes the lowest budget with the highest RIO to the client (one-man-band work vs a fully staffed crew). It also means you have to constantly validate your already bare bones budgets and your professional worth with new clients who just want to shoot their content on their phone.\n\nBesides going into marketing/social media management (which I have no interest in when it comes to a career), it seems like working for these creative agencies or direct-to-client are the only way to survive while keeping a somewhat stable income for my family.\u00a0\n\n\\------\n\nWhat do you guys think? What are the hurdles you\u2019ve faced trying to grow your career? And how have you found stability in filmmaking while supporting a family?\n\nHave you gone down the IATSE path?

Maybe he was always like this and it just didn't show, but at least in my eyes he had a somewhat good thing going before all this.\nI recognize that a lot of his videos in the \"good times\" were too based on Internet arguments and not actual writing advice or fantasy stuff or medieval history. That's true. But there were a few videos he made that felt really passionate and genuine, and they give me hope that if he could make videos like them once he could do it again. \n\nThe first video I'm thinking of is the one where he covered the black plague during the early days of the covid pandemic. I love this video because it took very scary current events and compared them to the medieval equivalent. Seeing him tear up about just how many people died in the plague, reflecting on how he would feel if he had to suffer through that with his family, really got to me. It felt so genuine and heartfelt.\n\nThe second video I really liked is the one where he talked about how medieval feasts worked and showed off a modern recreation he attended. I really like this one because it focused on a ton of little known details about medieval life and it helped humanize a lot of the people that we learn about that lived back then. One of the details that really stood out from that video is when he talked about how instead of using plates they would use flat pieces of bread that they would give to the poor after the feast, and I thought that was really cool. The average person doesn't really know that fact.\n\nAnd that's why I have hope that someday shad can redeem himself somewhat. It would take a lot of turning around, yes. But I think deep down he's just a very misguided guy that has a lot of passion for medieval history and fantasy, and I think that if he focuses on that genuine passion in future videos he could really turn this channel around. \n\nEveryone started hating him when he turned to political content, online arguments, AI generated art, rants about stuff, etc. And I think that all too often we forget the good stuff that people did before they entered a slump. So I think if we really want Shad to change, we shouldn't just call out his bad behavior and low quality videos. We should also try and encourage him to change for the better, to focus on video subjects and projects that are more positive, that focus on genuine emotion and connections to the past as well as education.

{"post": {"title": "MIL picks favorites and makes sure we know it's not us", "id": "1i30bmw", "created_utc": 1737064110.0, "selftext": "Hi there! I needed to get all of this out because I need to know if I'm being overly sensitive or if my MIL is actually crazy. Sorry that this is so long, didn't realize until I started typing how much there was to unpack. All fake names, all real BS... enjoy!\n\nMy in-laws have 2 kids, Zack (30M) and Morgan (22F). I (Josie, 28F) have been with Zack for 6 years and married for 4 of those. Morgan has been with her fianc\u00e9 Travis (23M) for a little over a year and a half and will be getting married this winter.\n\nLet me start by saying I knew from day 1 that my MIL and I weren't going to get along, but Zack was just too stinkin' cute so I married him anyways. And it really wasn't until Travis joined the family that I realized how bad it actually was.\n\nZack and I had started dating in early September 2018, right before people gear up for the holidays. We had decided that we would keep the Thanksgiving holiday separate (my family are all massive Detroit Lions fans, and I wasn't ready for him to see me heckle refs from behind a screen just yet). We had also decided it was too soon for me to join their family \"Christmas tree hunt\" where they drive all over to find their perfect Christmas tree the Friday after Thanksgiving as this was one their longest traditions. However, we wanted to celebrate Christmas together in some capacity. My family is rather large, I'm 2nd of 6 kids, and my parents will welcome just about anyone. With several of my siblings living out of state, we usually have our holiday celebration after December 25th, and they were more than happy to include Zack in our holiday traditions even after dating for such a short time. Zack's mom? Said \"if she's not a Smith, she's not allowed in the Smith household for Christmas\"... so yeah I didn't attend Christmas at their house that first year...\n\nThe following year, Zack and I were engaged, so we had both assumed I would join their Christmas tree hunt... wrong. MIL once again stated that I was not a \"real Smith\" until I was married to Zack and therefore was not allowed to partake in the Christmas tree tradition. We both thought this was harsh, but I wanted to keep the peace, so I said it was fine and was looking forward to doing it in 2020 (due to me having COIVD that year I had to skip so my first Smith Christmas tree hunt was in 2021)\n\nFast forward to when Travis joined the family in 2023 - Morgan started dating him in late August and both my FIL & MIL took to him way quicker than they ever did to me. Their first date started at the Smith house, with the full parent sit-down and everything. And then within a month it felt like they had fully replaced Zack with a new son. They had inside jokes between the four of them that completely left us out, would go on double-dates together, and Travis was ALWAYS at their house. They even bought a foam mattress for him to sleep on whenever he stayed during the weekend. But when Zack and I were dating, we had to beg like teenagers to stay over and I can count on one hand how many times we were actually allowed to do so (we both respected our parents' choices, so we didn't push the issue when we were dating).\n\nWhen September of that year rolled around, we had talked to Zack's parents and expressed that we'd like to keep the same traditions for the Christmas tree hunt, Smith's only. Both FIL & MIL agreed. But 2 weeks before the tree hunt, his FIL \"accidentally\" invited Travis, and Travis accepted. Zack had told his mom that it didn't sit well with him that I had been excluded for 2 years before I was allowed to join, and that Travis was allowed to come the first year he was dating Morgan. His mom told him that they didn't know how to tell him he couldn't join us because he was just *soooo* excited, and we should just let it go. Zack told his mom to \"say 'it's for Smith's only like you did to Josie\". His mom then yelled at him for ruining the day before it even happened. Trying to keep the peace, I told her that I was in fact hurt by their decision, but that I was happy to have Travis join. My mistake. Because that opened the door for him joining Christmas and \"because Joise was fine with him at the tree hunt, she'll be fine with Travis at Christmas\". We tried to voice that it hurt me quite a bit as I had to wait until I was f-ing married to join either tradition, but MIL said it wasn't our decision to make. She never once said she was sorry for excluding me. The only good thing to come out of that Christmas was that I found the gherkin before Travis did (two gherkins so we were paired up, Zack & Morgan and myself & Travis). When he threw a little hissy fit saying \"i only found it because I had more practice\" I said \"it was probably because only real Smith's get to find the gherkin\". Zack high-fived me for that one while his mom was sputtering angrily in the corner :) \n\nChristmas isn't the only time that it's been obvious that both MIL & FIL like Travis as they child-in-law more than me (again we didn't get along from the start, so I'm not surprised), that was just the tip of the iceberg. But what's been weighing on me is how they've also started showing how much they prefer Morgan of Zack. \n\nZack had worked at a local college in their food services for many years before COVID, when COVID hit, he lost his job and then had pounced around until he landed a job at a grocery store as their store director. He works incredibly hard and will work up to 60hrs a week during holidays. Morgan started working at a bank in 2021 (at only 19 years old) and advanced quickly. She's great at what she does, and Zack has made sure to congratulate his little sister along the way. The issue comes when his MIL make sure at our monthly family dinners to shower Morgan with praise and congrats and is gushing about how well her little girl has done. But when I try to add in Zack's accomplishments, she will say things like \"it's not that big of a deal because he works at a grocery store\". Morgan is in the process of planning her wedding, and MIL has given her (what we're assuming is) close to $2,000 for the venue. We got married in my parent's backyard during COVID, so we only asked for help paying for the tent and they gave us $500 (side note, those pop-up tents are fucking expensive!). We currently live in an apartment and we're not really looking to get a house. Neither of us likes mowing or shoveling snow and we're not super handy so we don't mind paying a little more to have some else do it for us. Morgan and Travis are planning on buying a house (which good for them, the market is rough and we wished them luck) and his MIL makes us feel lesser than because of it. \n\nMy final straw came when we had told her we're not having kids due to some medical issues that run in my family. We always wanted a large family, and might still adopt some day, but we will not be physically having kids. We have already have a pitbull named Pippy (after Pippy Longstocking) that we adopted 4 years ago so when we delivered the news, Travis told her that Pippy was going to be her grandpup as a substitute for grandkids. MIL was quiet for a *long* while and then said that she had expected her oldest and only son to have his life together but would instead look at Morgan for stability and insinuated that the reason we weren't having kids is because Zack works at a grocery store and that Zack needed to be more like his little sister. \n\nThat was last week and she still stands by what she said. It's been hard on him because he used to be extremely close to his family but after making it obvious to us that she has a favorite, he thinks it'll be good to take a breather from his family at least for a little while", "subreddit": "CharlotteDobreYouTube"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I wouldn't be surprised if many of you out have arrived here recently since 2020 or post a covid infection. \n\nLong covid is more than just having shortened breath and lower lung capacity, it has been shown in several [studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07873-4) that an infection causes a leaky blood brain barrier, leading to viral proteins crossing and eliciting an immune response in the brain. A neural response in the brain equates to neural inflammation which can be disorienting, lead to persistent dizziness and faint feeling. This can make you feel \"disconnected\" from reality as well. \n\nIt's almost like a terrible feedback loop because being chronically in a disoriented state from neural inflammation makes it really hard to connect to the world. I've been WWOOFing on an organic tomato with other families and individuals in Florida for a couple months now, working outside, low stress and in a low screentime environment, all things that should help with DPDR. However having these constant chronic neurological symptoms really make it hard to connect with those around me. Being chronically ill is kind of like living in another reality which feels like DPDR.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that what helped me a little bit is learning more about long covid, and realizing this wasn't me just going insane or crazy but could be a result of chronic neural inflammation. I stopped blaming myself, and getting rid of this \"layer\" helped me get a bit better. Still dizzy and suffer from DPDR but defiantly much better than I was before. \n\nI hope this helps.

However, following a large increase in my earnings, I was able to put aside some money, and finally finance my flight to the far east.\n\nSo, it was November 13, 2023, I entered through the large green tube, which ingeniously served as the main entrance.

In the center of it all stood a large statue of the founder, Shigeru Miyamoto, smiling and happy, just like during the park's presentation.\n\nI touched the figure with my fingertips and continued my adventure.\n\nI soon arrived in a large area, in which what appeared to be the protagonists of the series in the flesh roamed freely, taking pictures and offering warm hugs to the children passing by.\n\nI hugged Mario, Luigi and the little mushroom, telling them how much I loved them and was happy to see them.\n\nIt was then that I arrived at Princess Peach's castle, decorated to the smallest detail, carefully lit both inside and out.\n\n\n\n\nOn that moment, however, i noticed that something was wrong; I felt as if I was being watched by someone.\n\nI instinctively glanced upward, a big mistake....\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I saw was a small camera, carefully hidden behind the arches of the ceiling.\n\nI felt breathless, I had discovered something that I was never supposed to see, at that moment I had broken the system.\n\nNintendo, Mario, Miyamoto... everything they were telling the public, and what I consequently believed, was nothing but a bunch of calculated bullshit to deceive the public.\n\nThe so-called \"nintendo magic\" never in fact existed; it was merely a cover, a way to conceal the dark nature of the company.\n\nI could not let this go unpunished, I had to act, to rebel, to confront them.\n\n\n\n\nI headed toward the depiction of Miyamoto, watching the park with that perpetually present false smile of his.\n\nSick of having to shut up in front of such abuse I grabbed a large metal hammer, probably forgotten there by some worker, and began to beat it against the statue using all the force I had in my body.\n\nThe statue was predictably destroyed, reduced to a pile of scrap in the blink of an eye.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't long before I saw two moustachioed men approaching me from a distance, and once close enough I recognized that they were the Mario brothers, or so I thought before I saw them rip their heads off with those comically large gloves.\n\n\n\ntwo security guards came out of their costumes, yelling at me, telling me that I should not engage in inappropriate behavior.\n\nI don't really remember what happened following these events, in any case I fainted, waking up in a dark, cold cell.\n\n\nYou know?

I definitely did not feel like I was prepared to let go of that much cash, as it would have put me in a position where I'd have basically $0 after closing, probably would need to sell out of my non-401k securities, and borrow from family.  After putting in an offer, I felt the weight of the life changing (for me) possibility of buying a property, I sighed a breath of relief after another offer was accepted.  I promptly told my agent I wasn't ready and was backing out until further notice. I felt I just did not have enough to show for before making a purchase so big. (At the time my NW was less, closer to 45-50k)\n\nSo I come to strangers on the internet to ask for some advice. I have a few questions based on my current situation now that some time has passed. Reddit hasn't let me down, yet.\n\nFor context: I just barely hit six figures (100k + 10-20% bonus) At the moment, I have a NW of just about 90k, with 70k of that being locked up in securities across various accounts, and $20k in cash (working on building that up to $30k+, hopefully by EOY). \n\n**Should I buy a condo?**\n\nI currently rent right near my job in a HCOL area. But the rent is cheap, relative to the market near me. I don't live lavishly but have everything I need here. And the commute is under 30 minutes by foot + short train ride. I would love to enter this market, but multi families in here are way out of my price range, and if I can afford them, they definitely require some updating/renovating. My worries with a condo are that I will lose money at the end of the day, and it will not appreciate enough to make it worth it. Also at current market conditions, the condos I can afford would not be easy to rent out at a price that covers the mortgage payments if/when I decide to leave and start a family. I'm also worried about HOA fees. \n\n* *Has anyone had experience buying Condos in a HCOL area?* \n* *How was your experience?* \n* *And if you left your condo, did you rent it or sell it? How did that turn out?* \n* *What are some pros and cons in your opinion of having a condo over a SFH or multi family?* \n* *Is it worth buying a condo over renting?*\n\n**Should I buy a SFH?**\n\nI've thought about this option the least honestly, but I am open to exploring this possibility. I really wanted to go multi family because of the income potential, but I would love anything that would appreciate enough to be worth the purchase. I definitely feel more confident about a SFH being less risky than going for a condo, in terms of appreciation. And the flipping potential is definitely higher with SFH than with a condo. The downsides would be I would have to move a bit further out, and I'm really not at a place in life where I need a SFH. I am single, I work in a city, and am in my mid 20s, and it makes the most sense to live nearby, rather than in suburbs, at least in this stage of my life.\n\n* What are the advantages of a SFH?\n* Do you have experience buying SFH and if so, did you stay long term, or flip it short term?\n* Is flipping a SFH difficult? Is it hard to turn a profit? What kind of work did you have to do to ensure a profit?\n* Did you buy at the top of your range?\n\n  \n**Should I buy a multi-family?**\n\nMaking this purchase seems like the ideal first move, however it is obviously a much bigger purchase and would stretch me thin, although the upside is tremendous. I would have to go with an FHA loan most likely. With \"The Great Melt Up\" being the most prevalent theory for the outcome of the market, I expect asset values to inflate and I am worried about the risk of being priced out of the market and losing the opportunity to own a multi fam (I wish I started working 5 years ago, lol). I know I have some time but you never know, considering how much the market has changed just from COVID to now.\n\n* What advice would you give to someone who wants to buy a multi family as their first property?\n* Is it worth putting all my eggs in one basket, or make a smaller, more manageable purchase? \n* What was your net worth when you bought your first multi family property? \n* Should I wait even longer or should I pull the trigger sooner than later? \n* What advice would you give someone to be in a strong position to be able to take on a multi family property?\n\n**Should I explore other markets?**\n\nI have been thinking about this lately, because I have way more flexibility in buying in different states. In MCOL area and LCOL area I can afford plenty of multi-family properties . I am mostly worried about being so uninformed and new to real estate, and making my first purchase so far away from where I am.\n\n* Does anyone have experience doing this? How has it gone? \n* Did you hire a management company?\n* How did you identify a market you wanted to invest in?\n* How is managing a property that is so far away from you?\n* What do you do when you have to go to the property, if ever?\n* Any markets that you recommend analyzing for potential investments? \n\n**Should I wait?**\n\nI have a good history of saving $, and I am confident I can build more money as time passes as well as increase my salary over the years. I feel confident I can increase at least 20% on my salary in the next 5 years, and be able to contribute more and more to my NW. I am also exploring opportunities to make more $ outside of my 9-5 to add to my savings. \n\n* Where were you in your career when you bought your first property?\n* What was your net worth when you bought your first property and how much was the purchase?\n* What advantages are there to buying now vs waiting? How about the other way around?\n* Did you wait to buy? If so, how did that turn out for you?\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAny additional advice at all would be hugely appreciated.

Which is in a contrast with what a lot of people here are experiencing in a situation similar to mine. I am 28M which is currently single and maidenless (lol sorry I couldn't resist) without any previous experience with relationship or having a romantic partner.\n\nBut something has changed, because I guess that \"normally\" (with no disrespect to all guys/girls who are struggling, I really get you) like a lot of posts here this one would also continue how desperate, depressed, lonely and unlovable I am. Well to be honest if I wrote a post on an exactly same topic three or four years ago, I would definitely say that I was something of blackpilled myself (even though I didn't know the term at the time or, I wasn't fully familiar with concept of incel and incel community, but I had some general idea who is that person) and this post would be with high probability full of despair and hopelessness. But well, it won't be, as is can be apparent from the title and first paragraph. So what have changed and how I got to the point where am I now? I have now f\\*cking idea.\n\nSo before I dive into changes of my perspective, I am going to try to add a short summary of childhood and growing up. My childhood was pretty rough. My memories start with a turbulent break-up between my father and mother, when I was 3 and half year old. A lot of physical and emotional abuse from my mother and stepfather. I have been struggling in elementary and middle school in classes with finding friends. I was kinda the weird and lonely kid, who was ostracized at middle school and end being bullied or laughed at. After this I went to the university and the same struggles continued again, I kinda felt left out and had trouble finding friends, but I had a little luck and found some. Somehow, I survived and successfully finished university. Of course, the whole time when I was studying at middle school or university, I tried to find a girlfriend. I asked a few girls out and got rejected. I tried a dating apps like Tinder, Badoo, Bumble or Facebook dating to trying to find a girlfriend. Furthermore, I don't on how many girls I swiped or with how many I tried to chat and get a date. Of course as is apparent, without any success. And this whole my mental health was a total mess, I can't even believe that I considered it normal. I was depressed, anxious from all sort of stuff, especially from all social situations and people (even talking with my friends was extremely stressful). I was suicidal and often had huge mood swings. During COVID pandemic, I developed agoraphobia, so it was sometimes extremely hard to even leave my flat at college where I lived and get groceries. I also started self-harming myself with cutting, bruise my skin off or cause myself burns.\n\nSomehow, even with all this stuff happening, I was able to get a degree and find a job. During this time, I started admitting to myself that maybe I have some issues. Something like mental health and awareness about mental issues was pretty foreign concept to me. If I had a problem, I just considered it as lack of willpower, weakness.\n\nI guess this was probably the first tiny change I made, admitting to myself that maybe I have a problem. I found a therapist and started taking weekly sessions. After some time, she convinced me to find a psychiatrist and get medication, because my problems were just too huge to be solved only with talk therapy itself. Meanwhile, I started reading all sort of scholar books for psychologist and psychotherapist from various authors (Freud, Jung, Bowlby, Maslow, Rogers, Yalom, Fromm, Horney, Frankl, etc.) and about various therapeutic styles (CBT, gestalt therapy, DBT, psychoanalysis, dept therapy, transaction analysis, logotherapy, existential therapy) just to help myself. I guess that number of already read books is by now in somewhere in higher dozens. I just wanted to find anything that would help me even a tiny bit to relieve my pain, not only therapy.\n\nDuring this period, I accidentally found Dr. K. and his videos on YouTube. I don't even know how his content got to me, but in the end I watched hours and hours of his content. Ton of videos were great and really addressed my issues. I even started to regularly practice yoga, and started learning to meditate. But I was still desperate, often depressed and lonely.\n\nAfter I spent some time in regular therapy, I accidentally discovered ketamine assisted psychotherapy. I never used any psychedelic drug before, and also I was pretty desperate because my depressive episodes were terrible. Sometimes I even had problem to get up from bed, because what was the point of achieving anything in my life?  Everything was so pointless. So I applied to the ketamine treatment program and was accepted! During my first psychedelic session I found something which was really foreign to me at that time, pure bliss, peace, sense of belonging and love inside me. Admitting and realizing that these feeling were inside me the whole time was another small step in my path ahead.\n\nAfter this experience, I continued my life as usual. Attending to therapy sessions, taking medication, trying to live my life. And I not even sure when these small changes started to happen. Somehow I realized, that if always stated my feelings about my life, I always felt kinda terrible, but not unhappy. I just kept being persistent and stubborn. Sometimes it was worse, sometimes better, but I was pretty far from being okay. In the horizon of two years, I attended other two ketamine sessions. I even started experiencing with psychedelics myself, specifically magic mushrooms. I had tried them twice, but the first time nothing happened, the second time I got a really weak psychedelic experience. Which was unexpectedly still enough to make some changes in my inner experiencing of emotions. My frustration and anger towards my parents was just gone, after I demolished some of my stuff when I got really mad.\n\nMeanwhile, while I was struggling, I gave up on finding a romantic partner. At the beginning, it was from desperation and lost of all hope, because I was convinced that nobody will ever love me. But over time it just changed into something totally different and these thoughts that made me really depressed are just gone. I just can't find or feel them, and they were almost automatic, and it took zero effort to find them. Giving up then changed into not caring at all. But not in the doomer way, instead I just become at peace with both options (I guess it's maybe something similar what actually described Dr. K. with himself). Will I be forever single till the end of my life? So be it. Or will I finally find someone? So be it. Because in both options, I will have to spend the rest of my time with only one person myself and that is actually one person which going to stay with me whole time.   \nBecause I am starting to realize, that even I am single I am feeling fulfilled and authentic to myself. I am starting feeling more emphatic towards myself and other people. I found compassion towards myself and even discovered that emotional intimacy can be built between other people, like friends or colleagues. It's just not a thing that is bounded to your relationship with your romantic partner. Even more insane is, I started discovering that I even feel ahead (not that I am better than them or something like that) of people which are around me and have romantic partners. I see things in them, I wasn't able to see before. That they often unaware of their emotions or what they feel, don't know what they want, they have fixed mindset about their own personality and skills. \n\nAnd the most insane thing which is happening right now is that I seriously considering becoming a therapist myself! And I am like asking myself: What the f\\*ck, how did I get here? Because I still can't believe it. It wasn't even intentional, I just started reading these books to only help myself! Somehow appeared this strange inner force that pulled me in like a whirlpool, because it just felt right to me.  \n  \nSorry guys for such long reading, this post just ended longer that I expected. I really hope that my story could help someone who is struggling to find some inner strength, motivation and see that change is possible, even if there is no hope at all. Good luck!

I was ok taking meds until i got nausea, so I went to the ER to try and get nausea meds and checked out. Tested negative for FLU and COVID. I didnt think anything of it at the time. They gave me a shot of toradol, nausea meds, and sent me on my way. Next day im still not feeling much better, plus im getting some new symptoms (tightness in chest, a little more nausea, etc). So I go back to the ER and They do a full workup, EKG, CT scan with contrast, X-Ray.. All came up normal. Once again, they shrug and say its probably some virus, just go home and rest. So I go home, and spend 2 terrible days bed ridden, just trying to manage symptoms, I think by day 4 i stopped running a fever, but if anything I feel even worse at this point... So once again I go back to the ER, and now they are looking at me funny (like a mental case) but they still decide to run way more tests on me, labs, another EKG, Kidney, gallbladder, liver ultrasound. Echo-Cardiogram. They ended up admitting me but everything once again came back normal besides my sodium and potassium level. So all they did for me over night was manage my symptoms and give me some salt / potassium tablets + IV fluids. That morning, i actually felt about 30-40% percent better so they decided they wanted to discharge me, and I obliged. Fast forward to the following day after being discharged, and now I feel like ive relapsed, all old symptoms plus new ones? Pressure in head and chest, restless leg feeling (like i need to keep moving them) plus they were also feeling cold. One more time, I go back to the ER, and by now they definitely think im crazy, but our bodies are personal and we KNOW when something is WRONG. They did another FLU test on me (by this point it has been 7 days since i originally started feeling lousy) and I tested positive for FLU B apparently. Somehow this was a relief for me? Cause I figured now I have at least an answer and I can just focus on recovery. They prescribed me some tamiflu, and sent me home. I took the first dose or two and didnt really feel anything, but boy on dose #3 began actual hell on earth.\n\n1. Tremors (feeling like i have an electric current going through my whole body)\n2. Head and Chest pressure are back and with a vengeance\n3. Dizzyness and just general confusion ( i feel like i have trouble remembering certain things, like when someone asks me what happened during this period of sickness, im just hazy / foggy)\n4. Extreme dry mouth - It feels like the inside of my mouth is made of sandpaper, and no amount of liquids will help.\n5. Legs are now fully neuropathic? I can move them but they feel like theyve been dunked in ice and fire at the same time\n6. Rapid heart rate - its hard to even feel with my other symptoms but I have an apple watch I can check with. It does get lower if I lay down and try to relax some.\n7. GI issues - my stomach hasnt been the same since the early days of this. The best way I can describe it is that I have no appetite at all, and when I do force myself to eat, the food just does not agree with me. It feels like its just sitting in my stomach, and it causes a ton of pressure in my lower back as well as gas. When I am able to use the bathroom, it has been bile colored diarrhea (painful)\n8. Sleeping has been the worst. My fiance says Im sleeping, but I wake up every hour or two really uncomfortable, it feels like its hard to fully catch my breath while laying down and using my apple watch I could see my oxygen dropped a couple of times during the night to the low 90's.\n\nLong story short, im on day 13 of feeling sick and day 6 of officially testing positive. I went to the PCP earlier this week and he thought I could be having some diabetes so he checked my A1C.. I just got those results today and it was below the diabetic number. Now they want to check my thyroid ( i have a history of hashimotos but my thyroid levels have always been within range) as well as checking for a host of other autoimmune conditions.\n\nIm at my wits end reddit - doctors in the ER wont take me seriously, my fiance is beginning to think im losing it and that its probably just \"anxiety\". Im just genuinely worried that if this doesnt kill me, I will just live in this terrible state forever. Ive been out of work for almost 2 weeks and my boss is starting to pressure me to come back or take short term disability, so that is adding to my overall stress cause lord knows I cant work like this, I can barely even function!!!!", "subreddit": "medicalmysteries"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

The motivation to pick up extra hustles, extra hours, etc. goes away, and while I can say that in the last year or two I've had career burnout, I pushed through that when my savings dropped last year like I mentioned and don't think it's directly tied to that (also was enjoying the work I was doing when I was recuperating my savings). \n\nI put about half my savings in various investment portfolios to see if when my money was less \"liquid\" I could trick my brain into feeling like I had less than that $8-10k range and prolong the motivation to save more (some in crypto, some in stocks, and the 60% rest in ETFs), but if anything it made me more complacent in giving me a bit of passive income. \n\nI think this bottoming out in motivation around 8-10k comes from when I was 20ish I had about $10k in a college fund that I had control over, and while I did spend it all on college and used my own money from working for my own life/leisure expenses, I think it still instilled in my mind from a young age that 10k was the \"target\" amount of money and that once I had that I'd be good. \n\nI know that while this sounds like a first-world problem (and probably is), I have supported myself for almost this whole time period (I'm 26) even when living in not-so cheap places like NYC, so I am pretty proud of being able to keep my savings at this point consistently and my ability to budget, and while I feel like it's a perfectly fine amount for me to have saved at my age, I have been thinking about how by the time I'm 30 I want to be able to have closer to $20k saved up, and that while I think it's feasible for me to save that much (another 10k) in 3.5ish years, I still know that my day-to-day motivation to do so isn't going to be there if I don't get this $10k-is-the-target mindset. \n\nSo, any recommendations, tips or strategies that people have that would help me break past this invisible savings wall I've made for myself would be greatly appreciated! \n\n  \n\n\nTL;DR: I stop being motivated to save when i have around 8-10k in my savings, and have kept that savings consistently for around 6 years (I'm 26), but I don't have any motivation to save more beyond this point and I'm getting to a point in life where it would be a good idea to start saving more, so looking for tips on how to get myself out of this mindset of 10k is enough. \n\nedit: I don't have any debts/credit balance/payments that I would need to use the savings for, it's all my liquid savings.

I haven't seen an allergist since 2021, but had a positive blood test result for everything i was tested for except cats. the only other thing of note with these tests was that although i showed as reactive to peanuts on the general test (what i initially went to allergy for), none of the specific protein tests were flagged. other than genetic testing for psychiatric medications, this is the workup i've gotten over the past several years.\n\nvery long context to say that my technical diagnoses by my PCP are conversion disorder and fibromyalgia, although they have never been \"officially\" diagnosed and are instead written as my PNES diagnosis and chronic pain/fatigue/joint issues in my problem list summary. i've been in mental health treatment since i was a child, done a laundry list of psychiatric medications (26 as of 2024) and therapy including DBT for my borderline and PTSD, and usually when seen by a specialist am told that it's anxiety related and i should return to mental health intervention. i've made pretty significant strides with my mental health, and in that regard am much more functional than i used to be, but the things that haven't changed are the psychosomatic symptoms. i've expressed frustration to my doctors about this, because even with major improvement with my mental health, it doesn't seem that any progress has been made with the physical symptoms.\n\ni wasn't in perfect health before then but a lot of my issues began when i contracted COVID in 2022. i hear regularly from doctors that management and remission is very possible, and i consciously use my skills and tools to help manage anxiety and depression, but i feel lost when i'm doing so much better emotionally and am still having daily problems with taking care of myself. i've been let go from my last two jobs at this point for the risk my seizures and health problems pose to myself and the company at work. i desperately want to continue working and hope to go back to school for social work; but i find my health continually keeps me from being able to consistently hold a job and go about daily living. \n\ni'm not opposed to the idea that what i'm struggling with is a functional disorder; i think it makes sense especially given my PTSD diagnosis. my frustration is the lack of improvement with the interventions that are supposed to help and the lack of direction or resources from my doctors and therapists as to how to manage living with it other than to keep returning to mental health treatments i've plateued in. i feel very lost at this point. i'm not sure if something about my diagnoses just isn't being explained properly to me or if i'n truly not working hard enough at getting better. \n\nthis is a very long post, but i feel i'm at my wits end and so are my doctors, and i'm becoming increasingly frustrated with how much worse i'm feeling physically by continuing to manage this way.", "subreddit": "AskDocs"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I have been working at a rural school and clinic in Eastern Congo for about 12 years.  Right before COVID we had sent one of our 2 GPs to Uganda for training to be an ENT specialist.  He completed the training but due to everything that happened in the months and years following (I had scheduled and cancelled 3 trips as COVID restrictions dragged on, most of the NGOs working in that region left and never came back, etc) he has never had proper mentorship or hands on/shadowing opportunities. He speaks English quite fluently but is a little insecure about it - languages used at the clinic are primarily French, with ASL, Swahili, Lingala, and a couple of regional dialects. \n\nMy boss there is currently the only audiologist in Eastern Congo and one of only 3 in the entire country.  They have a lot of pediatric patients who need tympanoplasty, among other ENT needs.  I\u2019ve found a couple of people willing to offer remote support, which is great, but I really want someone physically with me at the clinic this spring.   \n\nI know Eastern Congo has a less than ideal  reputation but I\u2019ve been coming here for 14 years and happy to discuss any safety concerns.  We are on a very secure campus with 40 residential students (most of whom are deaf or HoH) with an outpatient clinic and 6 inpatient beds (mostly adult stroke/TBI). \nIt is a 2 week commitment and we do NOT use donor funds for travel expenses.  This would probably be ideal for someone recently retired.  If you or anyone you know may be interested, please reach out with contact info!

Initially I had a flu/covid really severely for 3 weeks after 2 and a half weeks I cracked and went to my local GP who told me my sinuses looked a bit inflamed.I was given antibiotics incase there was an infection that came with the flu. I Finished the antibiotics felt great and a few days later ended up with a clicking noise in my ear when the flu ended, I put exertol hydrogen peroxide drops in my left ear thinking it was wax.I Used the drops for 3 days and the clicking disappeared (could be coincidental that it stopped and not due to the drops) I stopped using the drops 2-3 days before the ringing started. Although I was left with a weird tearing/cracking noise when I pulled on my left ear lobe which was annoying but if I knew what was coming my way I would\u2019ve never complained about that noise EVER!!! On Christmas night after a relaxing none noisy Christmas Day that I really enjoyed after been in bed for 3 weeks with flu/covid I woke to a severe ringing in my ear I actually thought I was completely gone deaf because it was all I could hear. Obviously I don\u2019t need to explain the emotions that I felt to anyone on this T thread\ud83d\ude02 So again I went to my GP and they told me I have a small amount of misty liquid behind the eardrum and was given more antibiotics(Augmentan). I started the 7 day course in which I still had no relief in the ringing. So after 7 days I went back and the GP gave me oral steroids and sleeping tablets and told me not to worry it would be gone in days that it was probably a problem with my tubes being blocked.But after a steroid course, 3 weeks in and it\u2019s still here CONSTANTLY. It has been going up and down in volume every day it fluctuates between a 2-10( only in quiet rooms)to a 7-10 (I can here over the T.V)the sound goes from a loud ringing to a much less intense white noise sometimes. I\u2019m struggling at the moment with sleep and general anxiety and depression I had so many plans this year and I can\u2019t see even a future like this. I have a beautiful partner who I love more then anything and I know this is already affecting our relationship and I\u2019m scared to loose her over a \u201cstupid noise in my head\u201d. I\u2019m just wondering if anyone had any thoughts about my situation, Am i panicking to early? Do you think I have a chance of it going away? To all the long term sufferers my heart goes out to every single person who has had this for a long time I never even knew of tinnitus or even heard of it which is sad considering how badly it can affect people. I\u2019ve always looked after my ears don\u2019t go to conecerts or work any where loud don\u2019t wear earphones or headphones and only ever had ringing after a couple of time at discos in my youth probably I was 13-14 years of age only lasted until I woke up next day. Please any input would help.( I\u2019ve read a lot about habituation and everything like that and I\u2019ve accepted that I might have to come to terms with the possibility of it being for life). I take a bath and meditate in silence for at least an hour at night  which sometimes makes it bearable or then it can be sometimes barely noticeable after meditation. I\u2019m hopeful that it not being permanent but not depending on it. Thanks in advance to any information \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc God bless you all.

I was ok taking meds until i got nausea, so I went to the ER to try and get nausea meds and checked out. Tested negative for FLU and COVID. I didnt think anything of it at the time. They gave me a shot of toradol, nausea meds, and sent me on my way. Next day im still not feeling much better, plus im getting some new symptoms (tightness in chest, a little more nausea, etc). So I go back to the ER and They do a full workup, EKG, CT scan with contrast, X-Ray.. All came up normal. Once again, they shrug and say its probably some virus, just go home and rest. So I go home, and spend 2 terrible days bed ridden, just trying to manage symptoms, I think by day 4 i stopped running a fever, but if anything I feel even worse at this point... So once again I go back to the ER, and now they are looking at me funny (like a mental case) but they still decide to run way more tests on me, labs, another EKG, Kidney, gallbladder, liver ultrasound. Echo-Cardiogram. They ended up admitting me but everything once again came back normal besides my sodium and potassium level. So all they did for me over night was manage my symptoms and give me some salt / potassium tablets + IV fluids. That morning, i actually felt about 30-40% percent better so they decided they wanted to discharge me, and I obliged. Fast forward to the following day after being discharged, and now I feel like ive relapsed, all old symptoms plus new ones? Pressure in head and chest, restless leg feeling  (like i need to keep moving them) plus they were also feeling cold. One more time, I go back to the ER, and by now they definitely think im crazy, but our bodies are personal and we KNOW when something is WRONG. They did another FLU test on me (by this point it has been 7 days since i originally started feeling lousy) and I tested positive for FLU B apparently. Somehow this was a relief for me? Cause I figured now I have at least an answer and I can just focus on recovery. They prescribed me some tamiflu, and sent me home. I took the first dose or two and didnt really feel anything, but boy on dose #3 began actual hell on earth.\n\n1. Tremors (feeling like i have an electric current going through my whole body)\n2. Head and Chest pressure are back and with a vengeance\n3. Dizzyness and just general confusion ( i feel like i have trouble remembering certain things, like when someone asks me what happened during this period of sickness, im just hazy / foggy)\n4. Extreme dry mouth - It feels like the inside of my mouth is made of sandpaper, and no amount of liquids will help.\n5. Legs are now fully neuropathic? I can move them but they feel like theyve been dunked in ice and fire at the same time\n6. Rapid heart rate - its hard to even feel with my other symptoms but I have an apple watch I can check with. It does get lower if I lay down and try to relax some.\n7. GI issues - my stomach hasnt been the same since the early days of this. The best way I can describe it is that I have no appetite at all, and when I do force myself to eat, the food just does not agree with me. It feels like its just sitting in my stomach, and it causes a ton of pressure in my lower back as well as gas. When I am able to use the bathroom, it has been bile colored diarrhea (painful)\n8. Sleeping has been the worst. My fiance says Im sleeping, but I wake up every hour or two really uncomfortable, it feels like its hard to fully catch my breath while laying down and using my apple watch I could see my oxygen dropped a couple of times during the night to the low 90's.\n\nLong story short, im on day 13 of feeling sick and day 6 of officially testing positive. I went to the PCP earlier this week and he thought I could be having some diabetes so he checked my A1C.. I just got those results today and it was below the diabetic number. Now they want to check my thyroid ( i have a history of hashimotos but my thyroid levels have always been within range) as well as checking for a host of other autoimmune conditions.\n\nIm at my wits end reddit - doctors in the ER wont take me seriously, my fiance is beginning to think im losing it and that its probably just \"anxiety\". Im just genuinely worried that if this doesnt kill me, I will just live in this terrible state forever.

The most positive people have become completely different from how they used to be, and how different things are now: the quality of everything has dropped, everything is becoming more expensive, and people are meaner and ruder.

The first week we moved in we had our floors and stairs redone and this asshole's mother grabbed me and blamed us for ruining her crown molding and wanted us to pay to redo her whole ceiling. We gave her our contractors info and he went to her apt and he said no way did they cause that, he even told her that because she just had it done 4 months prior that it was setting, so off the hook for that. She's a snowbird and if anyone doesn't know what that means, she goes down to Florida during the winters and comes back up here during the summer. She has accused me of stealing her packages numerous times and even threatened to take me to court over missing packages. Her son is the real problem as stated blasting music till 3-4am when legally in any state you can't be doing this past 11pm unless you live in the middle of nowhere. Also in our state you ARE NOT, allowed to smoke within 30ft of any door or windows, he smokes pot inside his home and it is so bad that it has gone into our kids bedrooms to the point of making them sick. This is apt, you aren't allowed to smoke indoors period. So fast toward to the last few months we have our oldest who is now 12 and a toddler this POS has called the police on me a total of 4 times now because the baby is crying during the day, he has also filed noise complaints with our property manager because I'm VACUUMMING....yes you read that right, I'm vacuuming in the middle of the day. One time he called the cops on us and our baby was running fevers and didn't feel well. My husband tried to have a conversation with this jerk and he said F U, and slammed the door in my husbands face and then started blasting his music at 8pm till 1am. Our property management isn't doing a damn thing about this, they said well he has a right to call the cops. WTH??? I'm beyond livid. This is a POS 20 something year pot head.

Maybe some of the other stuff is stuff y'all can help with too?) **TLDR; at the end, don't worry.**  \n  \nLet me start by sharing a pretty humiliating fact (that's literally making me cry as I type it lol): I have probably drank less than 100 glasses/bottles of water in my entire 25 years of life. Without going into the gory details, nutrition and health were not priorities in my childhood; 2 of my baby teeth rotted when I was a toddler because all I was given was apple juice. And then ever since then I just remember drinking soda.\n\nI know I can beat these unhealthy habits. I was addicted to cocaine for a year (been clean 8 years now though woohoo!) and the year after, often referred to as \"the honeymoon stage\" according to a therapist of mine when I continuously glamorous that year of my life, I managed to eat healthy and drink nothing but water (I was also an alcoholic, which went hand in hand with the cocaine, so I'm 8 years sober from that too woohoo!) except for a milkshake here and there or a single glass of soda at dinner when my friends wanted to drink. This was about 5/6 years ago and lasted a year, maybe a year and half.\n\nThen the unhealthy habits started coming back in. I was working as a server and pulling doubles 7 days a week so I didn't have time to cook and just ate at work (it was a sushi restaurant so all things considered, it definitely could've been unhealthier cuisine lol). My best friend would bring me a super sugary mocha latte and chocolate croissant from the local bakery to start our days (we worked the same shifts) and we'd refuel with more sugar and espresso halfway through the day. On the rare chance we had days off, we would hang out at the beach where I would either get a single fruity cocktail (yes, I really managed to stick to just one!!! I'm shocked too!!! lol) and water or drink a couple sodas. And we'd be eating beach bar food, which is fried garbage. But we were working 14/15 hour shifts 7 days away running around as waitresses (she also did kickboxing, which she tried to get me into, but I cry when people raise their voice at me so I never did it lol) so you couldn't tell the damage we were doing to our bodies.\n\nWell then I left to NYC during COVID to get my masters degree in social work and I loved working as a therapist (past tense because I burnt out so bad I had to take a sabbatical or w/e its called) but it's a very sedentary job. And I was BUSY (I'm talking 8-10 clients BACK TO BACK daily with a 30 minute lunch, which doesn't even factor in the time I needed to complete notes). So I got into the awful (and expensive!) habit of eating out. Which meant a lot of fast, processed food. I forgot to mention that in childhood, we didn't have many balanced, healthy, home-cooked meals because my mom was always working (at a chicken place, so I was eating friend chicken A LOT).\n\nANYWAYS (seriously y'all I'm sorry this is so long. I've never told anyone this before but I need help badly.) I'm F25 (almost 26) and my ideal weight is 155ish (I know that's technically overweight, but I have gorgeous curves that you can see even at my current weight of 260, so they look stunning at 155ish). I know that cutting out soda (I drink 3 on a good day but up to 6 on a depression day) will strip a lot of that weight significantly, even if it isn't the only thing I need to do. I hate cooking so much because of my ADHD (it's debilitatingly overwhelming to the point sometimes i just eat crackers all day.) and super picky because of my autism (I'm technically vegan? But sometimes I'll eat fish if there is no possible way there's bone in it, even by accident, which is hard to guarantee. I also don't mind if something has eggs or dairy in it as long as it isn't the main part of it \\[except ice cream. i love ice cream!\\] but I HATE HATE HATE cheese, even nutritional yeast. The taste is horrid to me.\n\n**TLDR;** **Now that my life story has been typed out for people who couldn't give less of a fuck lmao, let me address the title question: water leaves me feeling MORE thirsty. Seriously. I drank so much because I felt so thirsty that I ended up throwing up. So naturally now I'm SCARED of water, but I'm determined to overcome up. I REALLY like vitamin water (specifcially the berry acai xxx one; iykyk haha) and I have slightly less of a problem with that water, but I just finished an entire bottle and I'm still sitting here parched. I've tried all sorts of waters, from Dasani (I know, I know....) to Smart Water to VSOS or whatever other ridiculously expensive types there are. I thought maybe I was missing the fizz, and I do like the walmart brand flavored sparkling waters which taste unbearably sugary, so I got a case of that, but I haven't touched it because I guess I don't like it as much as I thought I did! So I don't want fizz. I want regular water. But what the heck kind of water can I drink that will leave me feeling refreshed and not drinking so much to achieve that feeling that I vomit?!**\n\nThis was ridiculously long and I sincerely appreciate anyone who took the time to read it. I tried a dietician but it didn't work out. And I don't have anyone else in my life to listen to this or to help me, so if you did take the time to read it all, or even just the TLDR;, I want to extended my sincerest thank you. \n\n(PS: don't look at my post history. this is my nsfw account and i realized it wasn't my SFW account way too late to start over lol <3)", "subreddit": "HydroHomies"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I had no family support me and I went to a very expensive school. It took me 5 years to graduate since I took a lot of time off to work. I majored in Filmmaking and got a couple of prestigious internships right after graduation. Unfortunately the film industry is insanely competitive, and I struggled to find work in my field, having to take up multiple jobs unrelated to my field. Right before Covid I was working 4 jobs: a corporate receptionist, a box office manager, a gallery attendant and a news reporter. I decided to pivot into museums since I had worked part time for many of them and landed a job at a large institution. I finally got a full time salary and awesome benefits. However I had to leave my home of 15 years and move to a smaller city far away.\n\nI felt like I had finally made it, that the years of suffering from multiple jobs and the uncertainty of health insurance were finally over. I was saving for retirement and a down-payment for a house, had a good title, could afford nice clothes and actually buy Christmas gifts for my family back home.\n\nNow it's gone, and I'm back to filing paperwork like I did in my college internship just to survive. It's 17 years since I moved here and I feel like an absolute failure. Many college and internship friends have gone on to manager and director positions, have houses and families, are making strides in their careers. My own sister who is a decade younger than me is about to buy her first house. My parents are obviously disappointed and we rarely speak. I live in a tiny 1 bedroom, which is a step up from the 200 sq ft studio I lived in for 15 years.\n\nI've just been thinking about how it all went wrong and if the problem is me? I had so many jobs that did not work out one way or another. The most I stayed in one place was 3.5 years.\n\nMy bf has stated that the one constant thing is myself, and maybe my career failures are my fault and that I should look at ways to improve myself.\n\nI have some money coming in and I'm trying to decide if I should spend it on Therapy or Career Counseling. I'm leaning towards career counseling since all my feelings about myself stem from my lack of meaningful work. If I could just find that again I feel i'll be OK.\n\nHas anyone tried career counseling? Did it help you with your career? If career counseling isnt a good idea, how could I leverage all of my experience to find a good job and career I could love again? Any advice would be appreciated.", "subreddit": "jobs"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

{"post": {"title": "Am I overreacting to my husband restricting the people I can invite/ hang out with?", "id": "1i2ycbv", "created_utc": 1737058926.0, "selftext": "Hi all.  We have this situation and I'm so angry I'm crying right now, so forgive if I'm ranting. \n\nMy husband of over a decade has a history of accusing me of cheating. He was always a bit insecure/ jealous,  but it REALLY ramped up the last few years,  basically since the Covid lockdown ended. I think it's because i started doing a bit more by myself (like sports,  occasionally going out with friends,  things like that) after the lockdown and since our children were a bit older.  \nIn the last three years he has accused me of cheating with 8 -10 different guys on numerous occasions.  Like he mentions it at least once or twice a week. I don't know if it's my behavior (I'm trying, but not willing to compromise on everything) or just him, but the situation is really hard on me. \n\nNow what happened is that we moved to a new apartment and one of my friends from work was asking if she could come over see the new place with a few others and have a few games after work. I asked her how many would they be and she sent me a list of 5 our 6 people.  So i then asked my husband if he was okay with them coming over (we had issues with me making plans by myself without confirming with him first in the past,  so i now try to communicate better and get his okay first) and he asked me what time they'd come and who was coming.  So i told him the people my friend mentioned and he went through. He asked me for a photo of one of the guys since he didn't recognize the name, and i showed him the one from his profile picture. \n\nHe then went ahead and told me that he approved the other people (all women and one mutual male friend), but not the other male colleague he didn't know. \n\nI don't even know what to do or say. I feel like it would be very rude and mean to uninvite one person from the group without any real reason. I also feel like noone should control like that whom i can or cannot invite or spend time with. I'm honestly so angry,  it's like I'm just fed up with this.  I'm thinking about divorce right now,  just so that i can do whatever i want without neon by to put up with this.  \n\nIf this was the first time, maybe it would be okay,  but something like that happens almost any time i have want to spend time with friends our for myself. Either there are too many men in the group and it wouldn't look good,  or people are drinking alcohol and he doesn't like it,  or it is running too late (he prefers me to be home by 9pm) or there's someone present he currently or in the past thought I'm cheating with,  or there's a person he doesn't like, or it's an activity that he thinks it's only for romantic dates,  like cinema, or is an activity that he thinks I'm doing to look better for other men like sports/gym, or he thinks I'm dressed better than i do when I'm with him etc etc.. i sometimes compromise and sometimes stand my ground,  but I'm sooo tired of it.  I just don't want anymore. If I'm really doing something wrong and behaving like a slut, i just want him to leave me already, so that I can be alone and decide things for myself. \n\nPlease tell me I'm not overreacting here. \n\n\nTLDR: My husband frequently accused me of cheating and it has severely limited my social circle.  He now stopped me from inviting a person he never even met or heard about (as part of a group of work colleagues) and I'm fed up and thinking about divorce.  Am i overreacting?\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "AmIOverreacting"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

There\u2019s no room. \nLast summer I randomly started having a pain in my upper right jaw area and assumed it was my wisdom teeth. I took one of those little dental mirrors and I can see way back there where maybe a quarter of the tooth had come through. I thought it was just stabbing my cheek and that was causing the pain because I can tap the exposed part of the tooth and there is no pain at all, however if I touch the cheek/gum area close to it it\u2019s sore. It stopped and a week later I had the same in my lower right jaw area which also went away after a few days. \nNothing until this exact same thing started happening again a couple days ago. It\u2019s more uncomfortable than actual pain but it is a little painful to open my mouth wide/blow air into my cheek. I do have terrible anxiety in which I bite my cheeks a lot though so it\u2019s possible they\u2019re more sensitive. \nMy entire life I\u2019ve had sensitive sinuses and almost always get a bad sinus infection this time of year AND in the summer, so I just started thinking is it even my wisdom teeth, or could it just be my sinuses? Or is it my wisdom teeth CAUSING the sinus issues all this time? The pain more radiates around my cheek/ear/neck/jaw/throat but it\u2019s just so hard to tell. I also get sudden dizzy spells or times where I feel like I\u2019m underwater, like my head just feels clogged for a minute especially if I close my eyes (all new since I had Covid in 2021) but it all comes and goes. \nHas anyone else had a similar issue? I have an appointment for a wisdom tooth consultation but it\u2019s not until July. For now I\u2019m taking Nasacort but just curious if anyone else has experienced the same. I\u2019m deathly afraid to get these teeth removed lol. I\u2019m just hoping it\u2019s not urgent and I\u2019m not at any risk of infection & can even wait til July\u2026 I have really bad health anxiety after a horrible experience with covid and tend to assume the worst. \nBy the way - Aspen Dental did these X-rays last summer and weren\u2019t helpful at all with any of my questions which is why I\u2019m stuck waiting until July, so I can see an oral surgeon.

In the delivery room, I repositioned my mom intuitively, coached her breathing, asked the nurses questions my mom was too weak to ask, and even checked to see if I could see my brother crowning (my mother forced me to and I honestly didn\u2019t feel disgusted by the sight.

There must be some major areas I can improve to have better relationships with my children.\n\nI\u2019m unable to focus on work. I\u2019m unable to focus on school. I\u2019m stressed in all my relationships. I seem to be the common denominator if you will.\n\n\\-When I first got married back in 2010, I didn\u2019t plan on getting divorced. I thought I was going to raise my kids in a \u201cnormal\u201d fashion.\n\nI am the one who filed for divorce in 2014 though. I remember on my 30^(th) birthday, getting home from work, and my ex-wife was all dressed up to go out. Except she went out with her friend and two men \u2013 a double date to the movies and shooting pool I saw on FB later. I endured almost 2 months of her not coming home at night from the bar when she worked.\n\nI confronted her. I begged her to stay.\n\nI was treated like an ex-boyfriend and told that \u201cwe are broken up now, and I can do whatever I want.\u201d\n\nI refused to leave the home. If my then wife was gonna go run around at the bars, then I\u2019ll hunker down and raise my kids alone I told myself. I also had custody of my older sister\u2019s two daughters due to her losing them to heavy drug use. So for almost 2 months I watched my ex-wife go out at night and come back at 6 or 7 am while I was Mr. Mom to 5 kids.\n\nThe final straw was when she didn\u2019t come home on Christmas morning, yet I saw her on FB posing for pics at the bar with the caption reading, \u201cNo better way to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas morning.\u201d\n\nI remember my kids waking up and asking, \u201cwhere is mom?\u201d\n\nI did my best to continue on. I went to my in-laws\u2019 that morning with the kids to let them open gifts from Gramma and Grampa. That afternoon the kids\u2019 mom showed up, still hungover from the night before. We had an unpleasant exchange of words and I ended up going back to our house, leaving my in-laws\u2019 and going home.\n\nWhile I was at home washing dishes, the kids\u2019 mom came back alone and asked me to leave. I refused. She left and a few hours later Eldridge police showed up escorted me out of my home due to a domestic complaint saying I was threatening the kids\u2019 mom, which I didn\u2019t. \u00a0I rushed down to try to appeal to no avail.\n\nI attempted suicide that evening. I was obviously unsuccessful. I was arrested, taken to the hospital, then jail. I was bailed out the next morning.\n\nThat evening I was called by my kids\u2019 mom around 2am to go and watch the kids because the babysitter needed to go home and she was gonna be at the bar all night.\n\nSo, less than 24 hours after facing false domestic abuse allegations and being escorted from my house, I was asked to go watch them so she could stay out and party!\n\nFast forward to divorce trial. All I ever wanted was just 50/50 custody and nothing else. Yet I had messages from the kids\u2019 mom saying, \u201cHe is leaving me the house and the car and all the stuff. I just want to figure out how to get child support from him.\u201d So it was evident to me that I was being shaken down for money and I had the proof to support it.\n\nThe divorce trial lasted 2 whole days. We wasted so many thousands of dollars just to end up with what I offered in the beginning \u2013 50/50 joint shared custody and me paying child support. I just wanted to see my kids and not be an every-other-weekend-dad.\n\nDivorce trial is over. We have a schedule we follow. 50/50. Kids were doing as best as they could in our situation. They loved mom. They loved dad.\n\nI\u2019ll be ultra vulnerable here and say that I used to wait for her to break up with one of her boyfriends hoping she\u2019d come back to me. I was her shoulder to cry on when her and a boyfriend broke up. I would even help her move when she had a split-up. I found it impossible at the time to start a new relationship because I was still waiting on her to come around.\n\nI kept working. I kept loving my kids. I tried my best to have fun with them and be a good single dad to them. I was working on healing. I didn\u2019t want to be some door mat anymore.\n\nAfter being divorced for 6-7 years, we then enter 2020 \u2013 the year of Covid.\n\nYou weren\u2019t supposed to be meeting people in person. We needed masks. You guys remember that nonsense.\n\nWell, that is the year I met Xxxxx Xxxxxxx, my wife.\u00a0 We hit it off right away. We dated for a year and then I proposed to her. We were married 10 months later in June of 2022.\n\nBlending families is tough no doubt. She had 2 boys from previous relationships, and I had my 3 troops. We had to go through some bumps to establish basic rules and expectations, and we are still doing that.\n\nThe first negative experience I remember my ex-wife and wife having was over the boys playing too rough. I received a text message saying that our son was complaining to his mom about my stepson hitting him. 1^(st) I ever heard about it. It turned into a FB post and escalated from there.\n\nOver the last 3 years there have been plenty of arguments between us 3. I wish they got along better because it would benefit my kids for sure.\n\nMy kids used to be more cheerful when coming home. They used to enjoy seeing me and their stepmom. She never tried to play mom to them. They knew that. We have some awesome memories together.\n\nBut now things have changed. I\u2019ve reminded in text or email that \u201cthe kids see you put your wife in front of them. The kids see you put your new business in front of them\u2026. etc.\u201d Just endless negative opinions about what I\u2019m doing. I set up new chores at my house or limit cell phones to 3 hours a day and I get an ear full telling me to focus on being a better dad and not worrying about their damn screen time. I can\u2019t have a basic conversation with my ex-wife without her blaming my new wife for all of this. So, she is blocked from texting or calling me. I got tired of the conversations always going off the rails. We communicate via email, and that still goes off the rails with her expressing her negative opinion about my wife. I don\u2019t have to stand there and let someone throw up on me. Unless you can talk respectfully to me, I don\u2019t want to hear it.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I miss being able to have simple basic exchanges or sharing kids\u2019 pictures with their mom.\n\nI hate all the animosity. I want my kids to see and feel peace at both homes.\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine complaining all the time when my ex had a new boyfriend and telling the kids, \u201cYour mom is putting her new boyfriend in front of you kids.\u201d How sick would I be if I said those things?!\n\nMy kids seemed to have changed their tune towards me lately. I\u2019ve noticed the disrespect. I\u2019ve noticed they say things belittling to me that I\u2019ve heard their mom say to me. My kids are experiencing, in my opinion, parental alienation. I don\u2019t want to lose my kids because I got remarried. I want my kids to be able to confidently say, \u201cmy mom and dad both love me. They have different rules and expectations, but that\u2019s ok. They both love us dearly.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if they believe that at the moment.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to continue thinking my kids despise or hate me.\n\nI want them to love, and not hate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow can I facilitate my ex and new wife to squash their beef?\n\nHow can I get my kids back to respect me?\n\nIt seems to me they are being brainwashed and our relationship is being sabotaged.\n\nThoughts?\n\nIn Christ,\n\na struggling father", "subreddit": "Christian"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Now, after almost 5 years those symptoms are still here, fuzzy vision, a light pressure which won t go away.

Except now CVS has decided to stop taking scripts from my Drs office. The office embraced \"telemedicine\" during the covid lockdowns. They still do in person visits of course, but a good chunk of their \"check in\"/medication management visits are video. I guess CVS does \"crackdowns\" on \"telehealth only companies\" (Better Help/Talkspace) because they claim those companies overprescribe ADD meds/stims. According to my Drs office, CVS's system flags them as one of those companies (they're not) they reach out to CVS who says there isn't a problem because they're not in the system as being one of the companies to be flagged. Meanwhile all the scripts keep getting denied until they have a big corporate meeting with CVS IN PERSON to get it fixed.

I\u2019m stressed in all my relationships. I seem to be the common denominator if you will.\n\n\\-When I first got married back in 2010, I didn\u2019t plan on getting divorced. I thought I was going to raise my kids in a \u201cnormal\u201d fashion.\n\nI am the one who filed for divorce in 2014 though. I remember on my 30^(th) birthday, getting home from work, and my ex-wife was all dressed up to go out. Except she went out with her friend and two men \u2013 a double date to the movies and shooting pool I saw on FB later. I endured almost 2 months of her not coming home at night from the bar when she worked.\n\nI confronted her. I begged her to stay.\n\nI was treated like an ex-boyfriend and told that \u201cwe are broken up now, and I can do whatever I want.\u201d\n\nI refused to leave the home. If my then wife was gonna go run around at the bars, then I\u2019ll hunker down and raise my kids alone I told myself. I also had custody of my older sister\u2019s two daughters due to her losing them to heavy drug use. So for almost 2 months I watched my ex-wife go out at night and come back at 6 or 7 am while I was Mr. Mom to 5 kids.\n\nThe final straw was when she didn\u2019t come home on Christmas morning, yet I saw her on FB posing for pics at the bar with the caption reading, \u201cNo better way to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas morning.\u201d\n\nI remember my kids waking up and asking, \u201cwhere is mom?\u201d\n\nI did my best to continue on. I went to my in-laws\u2019 that morning with the kids to let them open gifts from Gramma and Grampa. That afternoon the kids\u2019 mom showed up, still hungover from the night before. We had an unpleasant exchange of words and I ended up going back to our house, leaving my in-laws\u2019 and going home.\n\nWhile I was at home washing dishes, the kids\u2019 mom came back alone and asked me to leave. I refused. She left and a few hours later Eldridge police showed up escorted me out of my home due to a domestic complaint saying I was threatening the kids\u2019 mom, which I didn\u2019t. \u00a0I rushed down to try to appeal to no avail.\n\nI attempted suicide that evening. I was obviously unsuccessful. I was arrested, taken to the hospital, then jail. I was bailed out the next morning.\n\nThat evening I was called by my kids\u2019 mom around 2am to go and watch the kids because the babysitter needed to go home and she was gonna be at the bar all night.\n\nSo, less than 24 hours after facing false domestic abuse allegations and being escorted from my house, I was asked to go watch them so she could stay out and party!\n\nFast forward to divorce trial. All I ever wanted was just 50/50 custody and nothing else. Yet I had messages from the kids\u2019 mom saying, \u201cHe is leaving me the house and the car and all the stuff. I just want to figure out how to get child support from him.\u201d So it was evident to me that I was being shaken down for money and I had the proof to support it.\n\nThe divorce trial lasted 2 whole days.

They loved mom. They loved dad.\n\nI\u2019ll be ultra vulnerable here and say that I used to wait for her to break up with one of her boyfriends hoping she\u2019d come back to me. I was her shoulder to cry on when her and a boyfriend broke up. I would even help her move when she had a split-up. I found it impossible at the time to start a new relationship because I was still waiting on her to come around.\n\nI kept working. I kept loving my kids. I tried my best to have fun with them and be a good single dad to them. I was working on healing.

I received a text message saying that our son was complaining to his mom about my stepson hitting him. 1^(st) I ever heard about it. It turned into a FB post and escalated from there.\n\nOver the last 3 years there have been plenty of arguments between us 3. I wish they got along better because it would benefit my kids for sure.\n\nMy kids used to be more cheerful when coming home. They used to enjoy seeing me and their stepmom. She never tried to play mom to them. They knew that. We have some awesome memories together.\n\nBut now things have changed.

I can\u2019t have a basic conversation with my ex-wife without her blaming my new wife for all of this. So, she is blocked from texting or calling me. I got tired of the conversations always going off the rails. We communicate via email, and that still goes off the rails with her expressing her negative opinion about my wife. I don\u2019t have to stand there and let someone throw up on me. Unless you can talk respectfully to me, I don\u2019t want to hear it.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I miss being able to have simple basic exchanges or sharing kids\u2019 pictures with their mom.\n\nI hate all the animosity. I want my kids to see and feel peace at both homes.\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine complaining all the time when my ex had a new boyfriend and telling the kids, \u201cYour mom is putting her new boyfriend in front of you kids.\u201d How sick would I be if I said those things?!\n\nMy kids seemed to have changed their tune towards me lately. I\u2019ve noticed the disrespect. I\u2019ve noticed they say things belittling to me that I\u2019ve heard their mom say to me. My kids are experiencing, in my opinion, parental alienation. I don\u2019t want to lose my kids because I got remarried. I want my kids to be able to confidently say, \u201cmy mom and dad both love me. They have different rules and expectations, but that\u2019s ok. They both love us dearly.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if they believe that at the moment.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to continue thinking my kids despise or hate me.\n\nI want them to love, and not hate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow can I facilitate my ex and new wife to squash their beef?\n\nHow can I get my kids back to respect me?\n\nIt seems to me they are being brainwashed and our relationship is being sabotaged.\n\nThoughts or advice?\n\nIn Christ,\n\na struggling father", "subreddit": "PrayerRequests"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

We lived us three together, me, my mother, her and our dogs. Around 2020\\~ my mother began showing symptoms of heavy depression, she had a rough case of covid once the COVID pandemic hit and had to be hospitalized. After she recovered, my mother(who was already dealing with issues on both knees and was obese) got bariatric surgery and started to show some signs of improving her life all around circa \\~2022.\n\nThose things came to a halt in the middle of the year, when finally after having to see several professionals trying to understand what was going on with her, one of them diagnosed her with fibromyalgia. Now, me and her have no idea exactly how it happens, if it can be developed or not, but she's been diagnosed with it and has been trying to deal with it in the last couple months. My sister moved abroad, so since I'm closer I'm usually the one interacting with her on a daily basis, which is why I've come here in the first place. I'm usually extremely against getting advice on reddit but this seems like a good place for it.\n\nI need help communicating and dealing with my mom. She's an older woman, who's dealing with the pain and struggles of the disease the best she can(I'm sure of it), but I have no clue how to manage everything around her, and she has come to depend on me for a lot, even emotional support(something I can admit I suck at).\n\nI have no clue when to be supportive and when to be 'tough' on her(insisting that she does not miss a therapy session, for example), at the same time, I have no clue how to balance, well, me starting my own adult life with the needs of my mother with her recent diagnosis. She'll ask stuff like ''what meds do I take'' or just straight up complain about the pain pretty much everyday. I think some of it is fair, I don't mind her complaining about pain since I'm sure it sucks a lot, but I don't know how to make her understand that I can only help her to a certain extent. I'm not a medical professional, I have no clue what meds she could take even for mild anxiety, god knows something like fibromyalgia.\n\nI've mostly accepted a role of an emotional sponge to her nowadays. I listen when she complains about the pain(which is everyday), I try to tell her not to rely on me on stuff like the meds or being present for her appointments, but I don't think she listens, and the thing is, I've been miserable. Seeing my mother struggle against it and seeing her get clouded on meds to deal with the pain while relying so much on me has made my everyday life way worse, she got fired from her job, has become unable to do most house chores by herself and while I have been seeing a therapist and trying my best it's tough not to feel like it's not even close to enough. She constantly asks me if she'll ever get better or if ''I believe she could get better'' and I have no clue what to answer.\n\nOn a medical front, I'm a firm believer of trusting the professionals and trying to look at what happens from a pragmatic perspective. However, on an emotional note, I have no clue how to respond to the new struggles my mom is facing and I can't help but feel like shit at how bad I am at responding to them right now. I don't want to place myself on the role of 'the poor son helping his sick mother', I've fought for my independence from her before this whole stuff went down, but at the same time I can't help it but feel like I just don't know the right way of answering her or motivating her. I've tried positivity to the point I felt like I sounded fake and foolish, I've tried 'playing hard' almost acting like a motivational youtube video, I don't think any of that ressonated well with her.\n\nSo yeah, I think I just want to ask for some tips on how to communicate properly with someone struggling with this, I apologize for the long rambling text", "subreddit": "Fibromyalgia"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I think Biden is the worst president in my lifetime, and honestly, despite all his flaws, I think Trump has many good characteristics that put him over Biden and definitely Kamala for me.\n\nFor four years, I have very much disliked Biden. I felt he was mentally inept, he wasn't true to his word, botched COVID, and, with the majority of my family in the military, they and I believe he really messed up the pullout. I didn't agree with many of his approaches across various policies and believe he just fueled the divide.\n\nThe last month or so, though, I finally feel a little better about him generally, and I think it's because he finally just gave the middle finger to the Democratic Party.\n\n* He got pushed out after winning the nomination, and I think they brought a lot of Republicans to a level of sympathy for him. Additionally, for four years, we felt it was almost terrible to have him out there given his mental state. When they pushed him out, it validated all those feelings, where I went from distaste to sympathy.\n* Throughout the election, he would undermine Kamala, and it was kind of refreshing to see him just be himself and say what he means instead of being a puppet.\n* He said recently he thinks he could have beaten Trump, which is like a \"F\\*ck you\" to the Dems.\n* He admitted he couldn't have served four more years because of his health, and there is something to the fact that he finally admitted, \"Yeah, I am old, and I don't have it; you are right.\"\n* Biden pardoned his son, which, even though I think it was wrong and means he just blatantly lied, also fueled Republicans' belief that the justice system is weaponized, so everything against Trump doesn't matter. But it also humanized him, as he did it because it is his son and he is a father.\n* Then yesterday was the one that made me really think Biden is alright: when the ceasefire happened in Israel, Biden went out of his way to say the peace was implemented and pulled off thanks to Trump's team. He obviously said his team was in negotiations, but he specifically said the peace deal was \"implemented by Trump.\" I respect that he gave credit to the incoming president, especially on such a major issue, and I KNOW the Dems DID NOT want him to say that, as it basically boosts Trump majorly as the peacemaker.", "subreddit": "TrueUnpopularOpinion"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

My dad (early 50's) my mom (Late 40's) my Nann (Early 70's) my brother (early teens) my boyfriend (early 20's) and myself (early 20's). We have lived with my Nann for many years, probably since she was in her early to mid 60's. She has never been any help for the family. This sound bad but when she moved in she promised my parents that since they were going to take care of her cuz she can't afford to live by herself (We live in Canada) she was going to help with basic things around the house or pay for groceries once in awhile. None of that ever happend both my parents felt like it was unfair cuz she was unfortunately another expanse and we had to move into a bigger home to accommodated for her.\n\nMy Nann is also I very spiteful person so they knew that if they said something she wasn\u2019t going to talk to them or was going to make things harder somehow. My Nann also has always disliked my little brother for some reason and will push him if he has to walk passed her. She even does the same to our dog.\n\n5 years ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Everyone in the house needed to step up to help her. I have always kinda been second mom but I took over everything that involved the house. My Nann was never any help with anything, even doing laundry. I always did everyones laundry on the weekend and she never even help fold her own clothes. She said she didn\u2019t see the point since she already did her part by bringing me her laundry. I found it incredibly hard and draining since I still needed to take care of my mom while my dad was working and I needed to take care of my little brother. This was early covid so everyone had to stay home which made it better for me since I was still in high school but I could still take care of the house and my mom since I was home.\n\n3 years ago my mom was diagnosed a medicaid schizophrenic. Because of all her med's that she now had to take they turned her crazy. Which doesn\u2019t always happen to people and it is rare but unfortunately it happend to her. We all had to say goodbye to the mom she once was. I have had to take care of her almost all day on her really bad days. I have had to skip College classes to be home with her. And where is my Nann you my ask, nowhere! She stays in her room and pretends like it doesn\u2019t happen. I don't think I have mentioned this but my Nann is my mom's MOM! Her own daughter! She tells people in our family that SHE is the only one who takes care of her! Which is BS! If both my dad and I are out then she will pretend to take care of her. One night my dad picked me up from work cuz I had to work late and when we pulled into the driveway I saw her peek out the window and then run away to her room as soon as she saw us. When we walked in the door and went to the kitchen my mother was on the floor not knowing where she was and what she was doing. It looked like she had dropped food and it was all over herself and the floor. We didn\u2019t know what happend and my Nann never told us what happend. There are so many sad moments like this one. My mother even now trys to hurt herself when she calls it \"I'm in another world, I'm gone\" she doesn\u2019t know what she is doing. She can't talk to you some days or she can't even function at all. And my Nann just watches. She will peek out of her room to see but as soon as I look in her direction she will quickly shut the door.\n\nSome days I need help and my dad can only do so much since he has to work but so do I. My dad and I have both threatened my Nann that if something happens to my mother she will be gone and we will pack her things and send her to her son's house. If she doesn\u2019t start helping around the house at least a little bit I think I'm going to loose it. I can't have a social life cuz I'm afraid if I leave her something will happen and nobody will be there to help her. My Nann clearly doesn\u2019t care what happens to her own daughter. I have lost all respect for her. I cook for the house and she wont help with a single dish and if she does, she will barely clean it.\n\nI'm giving it one more year and if by the end of the year she hasn\u2019t helped with ANYTHING AGAIN I'm done. I'm over it. She's out. I already have my mom to look after, my bother, my dad some days and HER. I don't have to put up with this. My mother is clearly gone and it already hurts.

I was quite hesistant whether should I post or not, but finally decided to do so. \nI'm 18 yo boy from india. As my mind's nature since from childhood was to ask questions,  i am not necessarily looking for an advice, but rather some perspectives from world around. \nI have some requests, please read till the end, and please try to understand the full context - as I myself am guilty of not grasping the complete content of people's questions, and unintentionally giving not so correct advise to them.\nSo my approach to this post would be to share my story compactly but with relevant details and then will try to sum up some of the questions, confusions and doubt i have. \n\n\n\nThanks to my very communicative and good parents - I know a lot even before my birth story. I was born to two little bit above aged arranged marriage couple in Maharashtra in a middle class Marathi family. I am the second child with an elder sister. \nMy childhood was --- neither great nor bad if I see it objectively, but for sure, it was a unique one. I used to talk a lot- Asking questions,  but only in home, silent outside. Used to be indoor most of the time, playing with my sister, or making my own games. I did have some friends, but my secrets, my stories I always kept them private, except opening some now. \nFamily atmosphere was fine, small but decent home, good locality, some family issues but that's kind of normal. \nThen as I grew into primary school - my characteristics started moulding I guess. I was definitely curious, inclined towards maths and science, but also towards Marathi language. Writing essays, doing anchoring in annual function, and giving speeches.l, drafting various Marathi and English plays, etc.  Speeches were actually my favourite and that earned me some district level prizes, and even doing a fully self written act for about 35 minutes, consisting of humour, acting and India's respect, to which I saw actual appreciation in some students' eyes (actually girls :)) These all were like felt pinnacle moments then. \n\nOther than that question regarding what's universe or what's God or what's highest number were like my common thoughts. In school, i was seen as a topper. My reason to study basically was I had nothing else to do, I wasn't much into sports or social gatherings. Again few friends in school, but I was 'respected', I wasn't much of a friend. \nGrowing up still in school, I started realising some of my flaws like lack in physical activity, or bit rude behaviour which I didn't want but came as  a result of teachers overappreciating me. \n\nMeanwhile I started getting access to internet in smartphone and access to some old but functional pcs, which like made new interests in gaming, knowing how computers work. In 1-2 years I myself got a working smartphone of my own, which further gave me passions of graphic design, science facts, technology etc. My academics too were great, and doing top was like granted. However, on the other side, I started feeling some burden of family issues and financial problems that might soon occur. All I thought then is study, and you'll be fine. \nAnd then when my 8th class finished, lockdown started. Unlike most others, i actually enjoyed lockdown, and also learnt a lot. \nMy family, I felt came together and thankfully none in our close relation got affected in COVID. My passions of technology science grew on. My inclination shifted more towards me- developing personality, how money can be earned, and self improvement. Whose fruits i witnessed when schools re-opened as now felt like a more mature, sincere student than before. Gaining some part in social conversations. Left the school after 10th , doing top in school, albeit easily. After that, i actually attended lots of prize ceremony with more friends' meetups - first time seeing school friends out of school in non uniform costumes- that all was feeling like best life till 10th i guess. Was feeling like--. \n\nThen chose a distant, very prestigious, actually one of the best colleges in Maharashtra. There everything, almost everything changed. \nI took my academics for granted. Did not studied properly. My desires of social connection, personality improvement- due to them my study focus slowly declined. I was never exposed to society like this - going to distant college through local bus, travelling almost alone, it was all new.\nEveryone in college was showing like best of them. Then the rise in the use of my smartphone and social media, too, significantly impacted my college life. \nI have so so much to share in college life. Like i literally have my own journals with descriptions of finest details of my thoughts. \nThere's literally a lot that can be shared. \n\nMy first ever standup comedy act - which was good. But after that many of my trials - like some roleplays, participation in some quizzes, my projects, attempt to be a part of a certain friend group, trying to showoff almost all of them failed miserably. And in all these attempts, my focus on studies completely changed. I started feeling that almost of all education I'm getting is useless. I wandered here n there, cutting myself from academics, bunking not just lectures but even some exam papers. The family situation too, worsened. As second son, the expenses of siblings education were rising up, and my old aged father was, and is still working hard, but financial problems started appearing. \nThe fact was till 10th, almost all of our education was free in school, thanks to toppers fee being completely paid by school. \nIn midst of all these kind of imaginary but reflecting the practical problems was me- confused, didn't know what to do, or had bit idea but unable to work on it. More than that, I took the highly unlikely route of competitive exams.\nThat too engineering exams. These way my two years of college - actually highschool of 11th and 12th went off. Preety average results. \nHowever, at the end of 12th, a nice thing that has occured to me. After completing 10th, and before enrolling to that highschool/college I  tutored mathematics to some vicinity students. Which to me was actually very satisfying. \nSo in  the last year of 12th, on the teacher's day, i actually gave a lecture on mathematics. Which was actually very complimented by teachers and friends with clappings. I got many compliments from my mathematics teacher, and she is actually a very highly respected and trained professor. \nSo those were main highlights of my college days. Also got 2-3 very close friends too, better, more transparent friendships than school, not dependent upon my academics, rather associated more with my personality.\nSo after college, I took decision to take a drop for JEE entrance exam. After convincing, The decision was supported by parents, which I'm again thankful for. My main aim was somehow to be able to help family. even without drop, my score was enough to get admission in decent engineering College, but the fees are enormous, even for government ones, i don't have any applicable concessions (open category).. \nSo I thought I needed time, to think, to commit any other forward decision. Overall, took drop year. Now things were looking hopeful again. I too, was on the path of  almost achieving what I was looking for. In parallel, some family issues were rising again, but I was kind of managing that. \n\nNow, apart from jee prep, i always had this questioning mind. Prep was going fine but the questioning mind used to always come in between.. asking if I can really become successful, and then it took me very far. I never believed in anything like scientific thinking, so I with the advent of youtube, and philosophies, I used to consume content like - is there any happiness, or questioning the meaning of life etc etc.\nConsumed many philosophies and thought processes - western ones, stoicism, motivational type stories and videos, and where most thinks stopped-  Advaita vedanta. \n\n Finally, one of the last important event till now occured..death of my grandmother. Her passing affected my emotional state for a long time, and many unresolved confusions occured..We were close. Though family issues and tensions existed, I used to-  in the back of mind, think about her, and help her in any possible way I could. As I mentioned,  even before her death, the philosophical concepts like immortality of self- the body dies, not soul were known to me, I used to consume such philosophies a lot.\nBut after her death, after the emotional state of me calmed down,\n my interest in philosophy, questioning increased a lot, maybe more than necessary. All of the optimism in me has ended. And, I'm not even sad about it. My cynical questions keeps on coming. I have in a way seen the meaninglessness of life.\nI think, till today I have always created a dream world for myself, but I no longer do that, not in the long term. In the short term yes, I do, even today, I'm not like completely depressed or something..I'm fine. I laugh, go to events, moderately active in social structure, learn new technologies and skills, overall life is fine. Even my jee prep isn't great- but kind of ok. In the short term, there are goals- I try to achieve, sometimes do sometimes can't. But my viewpoints about purpose of life, long term goals, etc are drastically changed. \nAfter sharing all these things I have the following questions.\n\n1. I , in between, due to all the passions and interests I mentioned, like technology, literature, speaking, teaching, etc.  think that I should chase those. Should I?\n2. Though I'm pretty confident about cracking jee, getting scholarship, and placing in engineering College, I still do not feel like that's the best way to move next. I think I should maybe incline towards research or teaching, but those do not appear like a straightforward path, and, required time vs expected money doesn't appear good there. Because though I like teaching, or technology, i have done it as hobby. Should I keep my profession and passion seprate?\n3. How much money is required in life? In this rapidly changing world of AI, is any career safe? What should actually be the parameters to choose a career over other, if the subjective opinion of what one likes is kept apart. \n4. My parents are older, and I should be the one taking responsibility. Sometimes looking at them, i feel like completely giving up over these long careers of engineering 4 yrs or any others- the desperate need to earn money, not just more money but to earn it as soon as possible, even this feels like a distraction. Any practical suggestions?\n\n 5.. I'm very sure about the idea that it's we who give meaning to life. So when we say to become reasonably successful in life - what's that reasonable level? \n\n6. Should I implant hope that one day i will be great? Is it necessary to have hopes? Should I train my mind to feel gratitude? \n\n7. My final question is actually a line in hindi, which is,\n      \u092a\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0940 \u0930\u0939\u0915\u0930 \u092e\u091b\u0932\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0939\u0940 \u0930\u0939\u0940 |\nEven while in water, the fish remained thirsty. \nThis line kind of resonates with me. I relate myself to that fish - and water all around, blessed with great parents, also with some problems to solve, access to all worlds knowledge, a satisfactory life with almost all fulfilled demands, and great people like you - who even to a stranger, read till here- all these paani, water I'm blessed with- why still then there's this thirst- and how to quench it.", "subreddit": "LifeAdvice"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

So I started my daily walk ritual that has been happening for almost 7 years now. Also began running at the time, but due to unrelated injuries I was forced to stop. So I just continued my walks. Life happened and I stopped sitting so much and got a job as a bartender, lots of standing. By this point in time leg pain was long gone, just some weird mysterious pain that came and went away. Fast forward about a year, COVID struck and a bit later I got a job as a receptionist. This is where the fun began. Over the course of 4 months, my leg pain went through the roof (or so I thought, it would get much much worse). In the end I was forced to quit because of my leg pain. 2 months later, I felt a lot better, not working and then I got offered a great desk job, so I took it. 2 weeks in, I noticed the same pain coming back, so I took some action, walked a lot, brought a yoga mat to kneel on, tried to stand literally whenever possible, made a makeshift standing desk at work, sometimes I would work bent over the desk. It was ridiculous to what lengths I went to avoid the chair. And it was a good office chair. I got a standing desk at home so I could cut down any sitting time I could. 3 months in, everything was great at home, and then BAM! At some point, my feet started hurting. So then I had to mind that as well. Anyway 10 months into my job I hit my breaking point, so I asked to be permanently put into the night shift (there was little work in the night shift). But the universe was like:\n\n\"Excuse me sir, but it seems to me, he he, that you're just barely surviving the night shift but is a somewhat long term solution, no?\"\n\n\"Y... yes?\"\n\n\"Wait a minute... THAT'S ILLEGAL\"\n\nSo the universe sends me a client who is active the entire night, every night, he doesn't sleep, he's insane, why isn't he sleeping or spending time with his family or literally ANYTHING ELSE JUST LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE\n\nSo then I started hitting my breaking point for real, where before I would get sharp sharp pain while sitting for too long and when I get up it's better, but now, I got to the point where when I reach a certain point (well that sentence sounds redundant) I get a yummy wummy sharp pain spike in my hamstring region and it radiates all the way to the feet sometimes, where nothing I do now helps, and it lasts for hours. At this point I cannot even hear my thoughts anymore, the pain completely took over at work, I keep messing up, being home was basically just recovering for the next day (I even worked 3 - 4 days a week at this point, it was still too much), this is the 13th month of work here, I got fired for messing up badly\n\nI didn't even care at that point, I finally got that sweet sweet relief. I started recovering again and this time, I decided, you're not gonna believe it, to visit the damn doctor! Yeah, I know. I did go check my veins before this, because I thought it could be deep vein thrombosis but that wasn't it, my veins were perfect. Now you might be wondering why I never went to the doctor before. It's a story for a different sub. But that's not why the title is so silly. It's silly because I finally went to the doctor, she told me it's probably sciatica, so we did an MRI and what a surprise. There's... nothing. The spine is good, she saw some marks or something but it's highly unlikely it's related. All in all a completely healthy spine, just a little scoliosis but nothing special. I also got that standard line of questioning. Does the pain happen when you stand up? Sit down? Walk? Run?  No it happens only when I sit or stand for longer periods of time (at this point longer periods of time is 15m). I am extremely active, I workout every day, cardio, sports, weight lifting, stretching, you name it. I have been active on and off since high school. I am completely pain free as long as I am moving. So the doctor is scratching her head. She diagnosed me with sciatica. She's not sure what's happening in my body or why but the symptoms are that of sciatica. First I got prescribed PT, like deep core exercises for the spinal column. And they actually worked. I noticed relief immediately after the first session. I have been doing them for about year and a half now. Right after getting set up with the home exercises and whatnot, I got a job in a store, where I would be on my feet and moving a lot. I was not moving as much as I expected and after about a month I hit the peak pain levels in my feet, after which they started going down very, very slowly. I could not lie on my back since then for too long because now my heels hurt. I am running out of positions to exist in over here! I quit that job after about 5 months there and am still dealing with my feet. I did physiotherapy about 3 months ago (TENS, some electricity, magnets, and laser) it helped a lot. Soon I'll be going for round two. I also did a TENS therapy at home by myself, got myself a TENS unit, it was like $16\n\nMy situation now:\n\nI can sit for longer periods of time, it's gotten a lot better. It's still not good enough where I could work again. My left leg feels worse than my right leg, so I suppose right leg is not that bad in comparison. Today is a bad sciatica day. Stabbing pain in my left leg. I mean this amount of pain right now is still nothing compared to what it was. My left heel also starts hurting before my right one\n\n\n\nHelpful exercises:\n\nThere are better sitting positions than others, for example, sitting up straight is a lot better than letting myself go in the chair. Daily core exercises are imperative. Deep stretches release my piriformis muscle so good (everything else too, but piriformis is #1 culprit, maybe I actually have piriformis syndrome, I don't know, the doctor covered all bases for recovery so it's cool). Leg lifts on your side, with a deep squeeze at the top for a few reps are bread and butter if I want instant relief. Deep massages also help a lot for a few days. I do them while watching something\n\n\n\nForbidden Sorcery Power Move: \n\nIf I do a STRONG stomach vacuum squeeze, like 100% power, it's like I unplugged my sciatica completely for as long as I am holding it. Maybe it will work for someone else too, when they want a short break from pain\n\n  \nI guess that's my story. I was reading the posts both here and in the r/PiriformisChronicPain and I did not find a single post describing anything like what I have. Everyone has pain during exercise or movement + sitting. The past year, I mean all of the years living with this, but this past year especially has been really tough. Mentally, I am so exhausted. I live life, I fight through, but it's an everyday struggle. I always have to look at the clock, see how much I'm sitting, when's the next break. Even now, when the situation is a lot better. On bad days, I muddle through my studies and go watch something, because at least in the lying position on my side or my stomach I'm still good. The worst part is, people don't get it. My friends believe me, but they don't get it. And some people just straight up don't believe me. But even worse, I don't even have any proof there's something wrong with me. Even my parents don't take me that seriously. For all they know, I could be lying. My dad just thinks it's all in my head\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for reading this. I hope my story helps you in any shape or form, be it the exercises I listed out or just knowing there's someone out there dying every day just like you.

For comparison I was diagnosed with BPD at the age of 15 in 2000, recieved no help, experienced abuse from the place I was diagnosed, and was not aware of this diagnosis until 2016 when I went back to the hospital that diagnosed me as a kid (which also refused to acknowledge that I had PTSD until 2020, never acknowledged or treated my ADHD diagnosed in 2003, and treated me like a pariah due to the BPD misdiagnosis). Throughout this time I was a person with unrecognized autism trying to make it in a workplace without accommodations, facing profound discrimination leading to repeated terminations, and coming home to copious amounts of abuse and rejection from relationships I stayed in to meet my needs, my dysfunctional family, and the every present demands of just living as a moderate support needs autistic person who internalized the profound ableism, judgement, and emotional abuse of the world around me. Even more so this is on top of several sexual assaults, homelessness due to an inability to maintain employment and secure income, a severe medical injury when I was an infant, almost dying from a surgery as an adult, being robbed, forced displacement from across the world due to COVID, a federal lawsuit due to discrimination, witnessing my mother and sistet almost drown at the age of 10, losing my first love to an overdose, and watching a coworker suffer severe burns from having a seizure and falling face first into a vat of boiling water. Throughout all this I had minimal if any friends, everyone left, and once the denial broke and I entered therapy I faced abuse while there, including being thrown out of a treatment program and forced to move back to the abusive home I tried to leave 3000 miles away from my best friend and the first time I was ever able to develop a safe community. \n\nThroughout all this time I tried to work and live as independently as possible. I went to college and graduate school. I became a social worker and learned that the only people that got the jobs I went to school for were skinny nepo babies or those with rich partners that could support them as they worked for sub market wages. I couldn\u2019t afford to do what I went to school for and when I finally got a job doing what I wanted to do I lost it within 4 months because despite using the job as the push to escape an abusive relationship and move across the country, I found my self in yet another abusive relationship, this time 3x worse than before. And this was a pattern. Find some piece of shit to rescue me and take care of me because I knew that the job would not last and in the process lose the very thing that could allow me the means to escape the abuse. Again I had NO idea I had autism and while I knew I had ADHD I just was told to take stimulants which much of the time I couldn\u2019t afford, suck it up and work my ass off despite going through hell my entire life. \n\nI kept running, finding some stupid ass low paying job where I was subjected to repeated accounts of secondary trauma (and even witnessed trauma myself including watching a child almost starve to death), lost the job, spent several months trying to find another one, only to lose it 6-12 months later over a misunderstanding or some bitch ass, sociopathic supervisor not liking me and treating me like so many of the mean girls and bullies I experienced from the time I was 4. I even once got fired for \u201cpoor judgement\u201d and \u201cunprofessionalism\u201d while I watched my supervisor repeatedly stalk clients on their social media and openly mock them to other coworkers (she also made fun of my disabilities to my face and did not hide her disdain for me). I had yet another supervisor tell me how talented I was as she fired me and I received an award for the work I did (and self financed because the program did not have a budget and I was essentially fired for requesting one and getting upset that I had to use my AMERICORPS salary to finance this) two weeks after the program terminated me and I saw none of the grant money I worked my ass off to get.  \n\nSo for all this on November 12th, 2023 there was a misunderstanding at work. I was frustrated and exhausted because I had no PTO to take time off to see a show because all my PTO was used for \u201cmental health days\u201d and to recover from the multiple illnesses my body acquired from working with children and dealing with a lifetime of chronic stress. I said something that was intended to poise a question, but was said in the wrong context. People freaked the fuck out and due to client confidentiality and fear for the safety of the client I could not say anything to defend myself. I dealt with this only to enter a meeting where a parent (not the parent involved in this situation)sat there for 20 minutes accusing me of lying about what I said, not giving a shit about their kid after spending hours trying to find specialized care for them, and telling me I was a piece of shit. I just lost it then and gave up trying to fight. 15 years of fighting gone. \n\nSo for those of you who have suffered copious amounts of abuse and trauma, how the fuck do you reconcile that because of the shit people have done to you, you will never be afforded the opportunity to break free and will always be stuck dependent on people who may very well be just as abusive as the ones who initially caused the PTSD. \n\nI did every fucking thing people told me to do. College, internships, graduate school at an elite private school, study abroad, unpaid practicum, volunteering, etc and for what? To face the possibility of receiving $1200 a month for the rest of my life if someone who has never met me decides that I am worthy of such a \u201cgenerous\u201d sum of money and if I was sick enough during the time some fucking government agency decided the hell I was subjected to was enough to determine me eligible for SSDI and not SSI and if me going back to work after being told I was crazy by a boss that denied me access to my therapist and 2 weeks after I nearly died from a gallbladder surgery is worth it. \n\nFor those in this situation how the hell do you make sense of the idea that because of the actions of others your safety is again compromised and if it were not for my boyfriend\u2019s generosity (he\u2019s safe and kind thank god) I would be homeless and/or back in the home I\u2019ve been trying to escape since I was 19. Please make this make sense because I spent my life trying to help others after all most did was hurt me over and over and over and over again. \n\nI guess the 25 year old idealistic, naive, and hopeful young adult who looked at my mother, while in deep denial of the situations that had occurred and were currently occurring around her, and told her that I \u201cwant to suffer too\u201d had no idea what she was in for and got a bit of sweet poetic justice people only wish upon their worst enemies.

(sorry for the repetition) ", "id": "1i2wnum", "created_utc": 1737054650.0, "selftext": "My first friend ever happened to abuse me from 1st grade till 8th grade. She was pretty toxic, but I couldn't leave her because I was too attached to her, and I didn\u2019t want people to question why we weren\u2019t sitting together anymore since we were known as the ''closest duo.'' Anyways, she used to bully random people and then force me to be on her side. I always knew this wasn't right because the other person didn't do anything wrong. She used to do so much worse, like physical abuse too.\n\nDuring COVID, she blocked me (we were in 6th grade). Then in 7th grade (after COVID), she just started talking to me since we were in the same classroom. All she ever talked about was boys and dating, which disgusted me. But again, I couldn't leave her because I was too attached to her, and I didn\u2019t want people to question why we weren\u2019t sitting together anymore.\n\nThen I introduced her to one of my friends (let's call this friend Sofia), and they got close pretty fast. I was happy for them until one day, the abusive friend randomly decided to ditch Sofia FOR NO REASON!! As you might've guessed, I had to pretend to be on her side. Why? Because she did not allow me to talk to Sofia anymore. But still, I talked to Sofia secretly, and I would delete chats with her after every conversation just in case that abusive friend checked my phone somehow. Lmao, it felt like I was having an affair. I got closer with Sofia, and we used to hang out secretly.\n\nBut I remember my abusive friend used to talk shit about Sofia to me, and I would just stay there because I didn't know what to do (I never talked shit back). I know this is very wrong, and I feel like a horrible person even though I did not partake in those conversations of hers.\n\nAnyways, in 8th grade, I moved schools and became friends with this girl\u2014let's just call her Sam. Sam was exactly like my old abusive friend. I remember Sam hated a girl for no reason, so she made me pick sides. I panicked and got PTSD, so by default, I chose Sam.\n\nPS: The abusive friend blocked me as soon as I moved schools.\n\nIn 9th grade, I decided to change and respect myself, so I cut off Sam (didn't tell her why; I just told her I wanted to be alone). But then she started approaching me, and I couldn't ignore her. A few months later, I became friends with this one girl (let's call her Emily). I loved her so much. She was so perfect\u2014she used to give me advice, and she used to tell me about her old toxic friends. So I aimed to be better than them and give her the best treatment. She was so healthy, and that was new for me. I spent so much time with Emily in the summer vacation, ghosting Sam. Sam didn't know about me and Emily, so one day, by coincidence, they happened to talk, and Sam started talking bad about me to Emily in hopes of making her hate me.\n\nObviously, since Emily and I were very close, she showed me everything. But I promised her not to tell anyone or make it obvious that I knew. I hated Sam at that point. She's very fun to hang out with, and she gets my sense of humor, but she's horribly toxic and just PURE evil. I continued the friendship with Sam and Emily like nothing happened. I enjoy hanging out with both. Btw, I always hang out with Sam during lunch break, no matter what, except for when I cut her off, of course.\n\nOne day, Emily and Sam got into a VERY minor conflict, and since Sam is toxic, she made a big deal out of it. Sam came up to me and was like, ''Emily is such a bitch.'' Here I got PTSD and decided to try to do something about it. So I stopped her right there and told her that Emily is one of my closest friends and I don't want to hear her talk shit about her ever again. I felt so proud. I told my other friends that I do not want Emily and Sam's silly girl drama to affect my friendships with them individually.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, Emily got influenced into cussing because she heard me cuss with my other friends, even though I never cuss in front of her or with her. :( I felt really guilty and confronted her about it many, many times. Eventually, I continued hanging out with Sam, and Emily continued hanging out with her friends (as always).\n\nEmily's attitude towards me changed, and I felt such negative emotions coming from her. One time I dropped something. She saw that it was mine and said to her friend, ''Never mind, it's not mine,'' even though back then, we would race to pick up each other's stuff. I still continued talking to her. However, she was VERY dry and not her usual self until we eventually stopped talking because I took her dryness as a sign to leave her alone.\n\nBtw, before this, I was planning on asking her what was wrong, but I was afraid she'd get angry at me. So I decided to leave it until the end of the school year. One time in class, it was quiet and awkward as usual, then my ex's name came up in a question, and she made a joke about it. It upset me so much that I moved seats the next day. We had winter break after that, and the day before the break finished, she sent me a paragraph asking if I hated her. It made me so emotional because I'm the one who thought she hated me (possibly for still hanging out with Sam).\n\nWe became friends again, and I was so happyyy. I apologized for being distant or whatever happened there. We talked for HOURS, and she said she wasn't joking about my ex; she was trying to bring up a conversation. Then she said a cuss word, and I remembered how I distanced myself from her because I felt like a bad influence. Anyways, tbh, the friendship didn't feel the same, but we still faked feeling like it was the same way it was before the drama.\n\nThree weeks later, she randomly hits me up with a ''Hey, there's something I wanted to keep until the end of the year, but I decided to tell you now.'' We had a 4-hour-long conversation (more of a debate, actually). She talked about how she always holds grudges and that she doesn't see me the same after I just ''left her,'' even though she has other friends. Emily is always with her friends and I'm always with sam it's always been that way. Lmao, she only noticed it more after the fight between her and Sam.\n\nOf course, I apologized again and re-explained how I wasn't siding with Sam and that I just felt like I was a bad influence on Emily and I felt like she hated me, so I distanced myself. She starts talking about how I gaslighted her into thinking she's the bad guy, especially after I moved seats, and how I used to talk shit about Sam (after she talked shit about me first) and still hang out with her. Emily was being very brutally honest. She said more, but I forgot. At that point, I started questioning my life and whether I'm a good person or not. Again, I apologized before she confronted me and after.\n\nEmily now hates me a lot, and to be honest, I'm starting to resent her too. She makes me feel like I'm victimizing myself while I'm just saying my side of the story with all due respect to hers. I listened to hers very well, and I justified all my actions (changing seats, for example). She now has a very bad attitude towards me, and I can't lie\u2014it disgusts me because she's trying so hard to act cold towards me.\n\nMy point is, what am I supposed to do?? I heard her side of the story, apologized for the second time, justified my actions, and said my side of the story. Yet she's still provoking me. Lmao, honestly, I am so tired, but this has been keeping me up all night. I never meant to hurt her\u2014it was never my intention. My biggest fear is being a bad person. I never intended to hurt anyone I hurt. I always try my best to please everyone. I don't want to be a bad friend to anyone. No matter how hard I try, everyone always has something to say.\n\nAlso, I forgot to mention that Sam loves me, but she's just toxic, and that's the problem. Sam is the only one who makes me laugh. I know she's very toxic and bad for me, but she's fun to be around. I have another friend who did me very dirty behind my back and in front of me too, but I still hang out with him. I didn't confront him. He's also really fun to be around.\n\nI just realized this might be linked to my OG toxic friend from elementary school. Since she was the bad guy I'd always be with, maybe this is why I'm always with the toxic person rather than the innocent person. I want to cut off Sam, but I can't because it will cause drama, and I'm too sensitive. She's also friends with most of my friends.\n\nTo sum up, can someone give me advice on how I can improve? Like, what is wrong with me, and how can I fix this? Please, I do not want to be a bad person. I want to make everyone happy. And what should I do about Emily? Her attitude gets worse day by day, and it makes my anxiety so much worse. I literally get stomach aches every time I open DMs with her. Be as honest as you can, but keep in mind I'm just a 15-year-old trying to learn from their mistakes and better themselves to avoid hurting people. \u2764", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

She\u2019s the absolute love of my life, she means the world to me, and this problem has caused her severe depression and it\u2019s been really hard on our family, as we don\u2019t know what to do anymore. She complains and cries every single day about it, she says she doesn\u2019t want to live anymore, it\u2019s very sad and my heart is breaking for her, we don\u2019t know how to fix this and we have seen many doctors, and none have given her a diagnosis or treatment- I found the diagnosis on google about 6 months ago- and finally, today, after many doctors, one finally gave the same diagnosis- \u201cDysgeusia\u201d\n\nMedical background- She has heart disease, had a stroke several years ago, suffers from anxiety, mother had Parkinson\u2019s, so we keep a close watch on her and she sees a neurologist twice a year. She takes medications for blood pressure and many other things. \n\nShe was hospitalized for sepsis two years ago, and has had many frequent problems with UTI\u2019s and vaginal discharge, pain, and just last week started antibiotics for Klebsiella diagnosis. She also has a polyp that was found during her vaginal exam, and will have that tested this week. \n\nBasically, about a year ago, she started complaining that nothing tasted good. She said that her mouth tasted sour or metallic or foul, she had just had some dental work done a month or two before so I thought maybe it had something to do with that. I also considered it may be a symptom of Covid and figured it would go away soon, Im always bringing her to the Dr for one reason or another, we just thought it was going to go away..but it didn\u2019t. She mentioned it more frequently, crying, saying she can\u2019t eat, she can\u2019t drink, nothing is good, her quality of life has declined horrible from this, and I\u2019m afraid the depression is going to kill her.. her health has declined so much BECAUSE of this problem, because of her mental health, her physical health is declining.

We have a neurology appointment coming up to see if they can give us a reason for this problem, anything- but at least now we have a diagnosis. The Dr today started her on nystatin, and took her off of Alendronate. Told her to start chewing sugar free gum. \n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what I\u2019m asking- I guess have any of you dealt with this with any of your patients? What is the solution? Is there ANYTHING we can do to help her? To ease it? To stop it? Could it be a side effect of any of the other problems she has had?

I am the breadwinner and the default parent. For years I have tried to help my husband pursue a career that was more worthwhile in all aspects but specifically money wise. He has always just worked random jobs to keep a paycheck coming in which has always been, just enough. I work OT as much as I can because we need it and it\u2019s available to me.

He is setting me up to let me know that he can\u2019t finish the academy because of this injury now.

He\u2019s always been a little on the anxious side despite early dog training, but overall he is a very sweet boy who loves people, loves other dogs, and\u2026. hates my husband.

Covid was hard for our boy, we had our daughter (now 3 years old), his older doggo sister passed away 18 months ago, and I started going to med school. I recognize that much of this is my fault. When I began school I just wasn\u2019t home enough. My husband has had to both work and parent our daughter, and since I was the one giving the dog the most attention - we would go on runs together a few times per week - he really did not get the time he deserved. Yes we live on a large property, he can go swimming anytime, even has a \u2018job\u2019 keeping geese off our shoreline. But it just wasn\u2019t enough. Husband\u2019s response to all of this was poor and things got worse. His personality began to change where he would develop these almost OCD-like behaviors, being afraid to walk down our hallway and a couple other locations. Then came some resource guarding, and general irritation. Most of this was directed towards husband, but he even growled at my toddler a couple times. We spoke with our vet and put him on meds that worked for a while. Dosage adjustment, then a new med regimen, then short-term anxiolytics. But he bit my husband and drew blood. We have to be responsible parents and I know we can not trust him around our 3 year old anymore. I definitely do not trust him around my husband. I took him with me for 2 months when I had to move away for school clinical rotations and our pup was much improved, but I moved back in with my family when that was over. I\u2019m a mom and a wife. I can\u2019t and do not want to live away from them for years until the dog passes. We hired a behaviorist and they said they \\*could\\* work with us, but my husband is justifiably scared of him and both of us are not comfortable because of our daughter. For these reasons the behaviorist recommends rehoming or behavioral euthanasia.\n\n\n\nI truly believe in my heart he could have a happy life in a different home. But I\u2019m also terrified of him living his remaining days in a kennel, and frankly we can not find a single shelter willing to accept a dog (especially one with a documented bite history). The behaviorist told us if we rehomed him directly to a new owner we would likely be held liable if he were to bite again, even if we were to completely disclose which of course we would. So I would like to know if that really is true, or if there is an avenue for us to protect ourselves from financial ruin by formally disclosing his history. Is this even possible? Does anyone have any suggestions? After dragging our feet for months we just had to schedule an appointment to put him down this coming Monday. I hate myself for allowing this to happen and at the same time I feel incredibly helpless. I will never forgive myself if we have to euthanize, but I owe it to my family to feel safe, and I have a responsibility to my dog to not have to endure a life in a cage. Please help. Please.\n\n", "subreddit": "legaladvice"}, "sentiment": "negative"}
{"post": {"title": "How DEI Is Destroying L.A.\u2019s Fire Department", "id": "1i2w95d", "created_utc": 1737053634.0, "selftext": "**Today, we\u2019ll do a deeper dive into the DEI program in the Los Angeles Fire Department. The Left insists that it has nothing to do with the catastrophe unfolding in LA right now - but of course, they\u2019re lying. Also, how many of these fires are being intentionally set? We\u2019ll talk about that.**\n\nThere\u2019s now a very noticeable pattern that plays out every time we witness a colossal failure on the national stage. It happened after the Secret Service allowed Donald Trump to get shot in the head in Pennsylvania, it happened after Harvard\u2019s president was exposed for plagiarism, after Kamala Harris lost the presidential election.\n\nAnd here\u2019s how it usually goes: Conservatives pointed out that DEI was involved in some way, and then everyone on the Left acted with shock and indignation at the mere suggestion that DEI might have backfired.\n\nDEI, they tell us, is an essential mandate that always adds value\u2014it\u2019s vital to every organization\u2014and then, in the same breath, they tell us that DEI can\u2019t possibly be related to any failure by any organization or government agency that practices DEI - in other words, DEI is either critically and fundamentally important or not important at all, depending on how things are going.\n\nAs entire neighborhoods in Los Angeles are destroyed by fires, once again, we\u2019re seeing this very familiar pattern play out. As we talked about yesterday, conservatives have pointed out, rightly, that DEI has infected every aspect of the government of Los Angeles\u2014in particular its Fire Department\u2014and in response, as they usually do, the Left has insisted that DEI actually has nothing whatsoever to do with the fires, or the disastrous response to them. And they\u2019re wagging their fingers at anyone who suggests otherwise - because things have gone wrong, therefore, DEI is now irrelevant. That\u2019s the way that it goes.\n\nRolling Stone, in particular, was upset with the Right\u2019s response to the wildfires - they published an article the other day [entitled,](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/right-wingers-blame-los-angeles-fires-diversity-democrats-1235230047/) \u201cRIGHT-WINGERS ARE BLAMING THE L.A. FIRES ON DIVERSITY.\u201d [Here\u2019s part of it:](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/right-wingers-blame-los-angeles-fires-diversity-democrats-1235230047/) \u201cClimate-denying conservatives are instead blaming the devastation on California\u2019s \u2018woke\u2019 policies. \u2026 \u2018Los Angeles deliberately set out to exclude white men from becoming firefighters, and now they don\u2019t have enough firefighters to prevent their city from burning to the ground,\u2019 wrote right-wing commentator Matt Walsh in one post endorsed by Elon Musk. \u2018DEI is a cancer that destroys everything it touches.'\u201d\n\nNow, first of all, I had to look up who wrote this article, because it reads like something the Daily Wire\u2019s PR department would come up with. The whole article is just a series of quotes\u2014from Matt Walsh, Alex Jones, Elon Musk, Megyn Kelly, and so on\u2014and sure enough, the author is one Nikki McCann Ramirez, who\u2019s a former Media Matters staffer. So she made her living doing unofficial PR for the Daily Wire, and now she\u2019s gone to Rolling Stone, doing the same thing - she apparently found another organization that\u2019s willing to pay her to write articles about conservatives\u2019 tweets, after Elon Musk sued Media Matters into the ground.\n\nNow, the only original contribution that Nikki Ramirez made to this article is this line of commentary at the end, it reads: \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that the fire department\u2019s push for diversity has any effect on its ability to fight fires.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a line that made me realize we need to do another deep-dive on DEI in the Los Angeles Fire Department, because it\u2019s completely false. But of course, a lot of people on the Left are still repeating it. And they\u2019re repeating this line because they think it\u2019s safe; in their minds, it\u2019s impossible to find a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that proves DEI leads directly to failure - after all, DEI is a bureaucratic system, and the whole point of bureaucracy is to make it impossible to assign blame.\n\nNow, unfortunately for Rolling Stone and the rest of these activists, the leaders of the Los Angeles Fire Department have not been subtle about their DEI policies, and the impact these policies have on their job performance - in fact, they\u2019ve actually been quite **direct** about it. Here\u2019s a video of Deputy Chief Kristine Larson, who\u2019s the head of the Fire Department\u2019s \u201cEquity and Human Resources Bureau.\u201d And you may have seen a shortened version of this video online, because it\u2019s going viral. I found a [longer, unedited version](https://youtu.be/bnkHLJtjdB0) of it, and it\u2019s worth watching because it implicates both the LAPD **and** the LAFD, and it also includes the context, to the extent you need it. Here it is:\n\n>*ON-SCREEN TEXT: Women and minorities are underrepresented as first responders.*\n\n>*KRISTINE LARSON: \u201cThe reality is, you're not one of the boys, you never **will** be one of the boys, but you can be a good firefighter.\u201d*\n\n>*TEXT: ATTN: x FOX\u2019s 9-1-1 ASKED A FEW WOMEN OF COLOR TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AT THE LAPD AND LAFD.*\n\n>*LAPD SERGEANT: \u201cPeople see you, and they're like, \u2018Wow, look at you,\u2019 you know, they're so excited. Here's a female black officer, \u2019cause there\u2019s not a lot of us.\u201d*\n\n>*KRISTINE LARSON: \u201cYou wanna see somebody that responds to your house, your emergency\u2014whether it's a medical call or a fire call\u2014that looks like you. It gives that person a little bit more ease, knowing that somebody might understand their situation better. \u2026 You can't be it if you can't see it, and so that's why it's important for young girls to see women riding around on fire trucks. Plus, it's fun.\u201d* \n\n>*TEXT: Only about 5% of working firefighters are women.\n\n>*KRISTINE LARSON: \u201c\u2018Is she strong enough to do this,\u2019 or, \u2018You couldn't carry my husband out of a fire.\u2019 Which my response is, \u2018He got himself in the wrong place if I have to carry him out of a fire.\u2019\u201d*\n\n>*TEXT: Just 1% of women in law enforcement serve as lieutenants, captains or higher.\n\n>*KRISTINE LARSON: \u201cI was the first African-American female promoted to the rank of Battalion Chief. With each promotion, more eyes come on you, more scrutiny, they want to know, \u201cDoes she know what she's doing, does she keep her crew safe\u2026\u2019\u201d*\n\nYou know, it looks like some kind of AI-generated parody, but it\u2019s not. So let\u2019s review what we just saw.\n\nThe first claim from the Deputy Fire Chief is that, when you have a medical emergency, or when your house is on fire, all you care about is seeing first responders who \u201clook like you.\u201d You don\u2019t care if they\u2019re good at their jobs; you\u2019re not worried about whether could do CPR, or whether they can actually put out a fire, or whether they can pick you up if you\u2019re incapacitated and carry out of a burning building. Instead, the most important thing is the appearance of the firefighter - meaning their skin color and gender. And the LAPD sergeant agrees with that.\n\nNow, this is not a claim that needs to be broken down and dissected in a million different ways\u2014I think to most sane people, the problems here are quite self evident. But just for fun, let\u2019s analyze this a little bit.\n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s assume this is true - let\u2019s assume that when white people call 911 in Los Angeles because their house is burning down, they really don\u2019t want to see black firefighters show up. So when a team of all-white firefighters show up, in Kristine Lawson\u2019s worldview, it\u2019d be totally normal and appropriate for the white homeowner to say, \u201cWell, thank God they didn\u2019t send any black firefighters.\u201d After all, he wants to see people who look like him. What\u2019s wrong with that? In fact, maybe if he **is** incapacitated and can\u2019t leave the building on his own, and he sees that these are firefighters that don\u2019t look like him, he might say, \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather burn to death. Send some white people or I\u2019m not interested.\u201d\n\nNow, of course, what Kristine Larson really means is that **non**-white victims should want to see non-white firefighters respond to their house, but there\u2019s still a big problem here, because I\u2019d wager a lot of money that there is not a single black person on the **planet** who would react with relief or joy if they called 911 and someone like Kristine Larson waddled up to their door. I mean, that would be a moment of **sheer panic** for **anyone,** regardless of skin color. That would be the moment when they basically know their life is over.\n\nBut even if we assume that black people demand to be saved by overweight black lesbian firefighters like Kristine Larson, there\u2019s still another problem with Larson\u2019s explanation, which is this: How exactly would dispatchers **know** what race of firefighters to **send** to a particular call? Should the dispatcher demand to know the callers\u2019 race? Should they do a quick demographic poll to figure out who this is, so they can dispatch race-matching fire crews? Is any of that happening right now in Los Angeles? By the logic of the Deputy Fire Chief, it SHOULD be happening.\n\nAnd then, of course, comes the second part of the video, in which Larson responds to someone who\u2019s worried that, as an overweight black lesbian, she won\u2019t be able to **lift** a man and remove him from a house fire, which of course is true. When you talk about a man even of **average** size, there are almost no women on the planet who could successfully lift a man like that on their own and bring him to safety. Now, Larson\u2019s response is that the man shouldn\u2019t have put himself in that position in the first place. So it\u2019s his fault for being in a position where his house is burning down.\n\nNow, she couldn\u2019t be making it any clearer that DEI hiring compromises the fire department\u2019s ability to do its job. She thinks it\u2019s like a laugh line, apparently. This is how DEI hires at the **highest levels** of the Los Angeles Fire Department are talking about the impact of DEI on their jobs.\n\nBut Larson has never been disqualified or punished in any way. She has a job paying well over $300,000 a year at the Los Angeles Fire Department, in which she enforces various equity mandates while she laughs at people who ask why she\u2019s so overweight. And part of that job apparently entails [weeding out alleged \u201cbigots\u201d](https://youtu.be/Zy91lf-YNnY) in the ranks of the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\n>*LARSON: \u201cSo I want to reach down and bring you up. And that's kind of something that stuck with me to this day.\u201d*\n\n>*REPORTER: \u201cPart of that work means speaking up for those who can't. Aver the last few years, LAFD has dealt with a fair share of controversy, and Larsson, not afraid to sound the alarm.\u201d*\n\n>*LARSON: \u201cI chose to speak out\u2014pretty much by myself\u2014about the issues of sexism and racism within my department, and the need for change. I don't think there's any question that our department is the best at fighting fires. We do it better than anybody in the world. But when it comes to the personnel side, we have some issues, and they're not insurmountable, but they need to be addressed and fixed to the best of everybody's ability.\u201d*\n\nThis is reminiscent of Lloyd Austin\u2019s big plan to purge the Pentagon of \u201cextremist white supremacists,\u201d by which he meant, white people who support Donald Trump and refuse to take the COVID shot. It\u2019s the kind of thing that no public agency in the United States should be doing, for about a million reasons.\n\nFirst of all, the idea of \u201cracism\u201d in fire departments and police departments has been stretched beyond all recognition, to the point that it\u2019s completely meaningless. Fire departments all over the country are getting sued right now for \u201cracism\u201d because they attempt to enforce basic standards of literacy and competence in the admissions process.\n\nSecondly, this is a department that\u2019s now very short of manpower during a historic crisis. Barring extreme circumstances, you should not be weeding out ANY competent firefighters right now. The Los Angeles Fire Department should be focused on retaining as many firefighters as possible - not firing them for liking an offensive meme or something. And if you doubt that, take a look at Ferguson, or Minneapolis, or Baltimore. Have any of these cities become safer after the BLM revolution? Of course not.\n\nNow, the **real** purpose of all of these purges is to punish anyone who thinks an unapproved thought that also happens to be true. They don\u2019t want people to make obvious observations like this one: Women should not be firefighters **at all.** Any effort to include more women is by definition an effort to make the fire department **less equipped** and **less capable,** by definition.\n\nThe same is true for police departments, which are being gutted all over the country in the name of equity. Just this week, the Maryland State Police agreed to a $3 million settlement with Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ over their hiring practices - [as one local news station reports:](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/maryland-state-police-agree-27-million-settlement-civil-rights-lawsuit/63381102) \u201cThe lawsuit claimed that the Maryland Department of State Police violated Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it used a certain physical fitness test and a certain written test to hire entry-level troopers. The lawsuit claimed the tests disqualified more women and African American applicants than others and were not job-related.\u201d\n\nIn other words, in the world of policing, **physical fitness and literacy** are no longer \u201cjob-related.\u201d That\u2019s how these police and fire departments operate now, they know they have to hire and promote incompetent people.\n\nThis is the kind of **deliberate sabotage** that has **directly** contributed to the disaster that\u2019s unfolding in Los Angeles. No matter what anybody on the Left says, no matter what anyone in the media says, these things are directly linked. They HAVE to be. Instead of spending every moment thinking about protecting their state, the leadership of California has been busy appointing \u201cequity\u201d overseers, so, when a disaster occurs, they have no idea what to do.\n\nThat led to this clown-car performance from Gavin Newsom last week - he told a constituent he was on the phone with Joe Biden, and then, when she asked to talk to Joe Biden, he [admitted he didn\u2019t have cell service.](https://youtu.be/WVF3R_8k3no) It\u2019s like something out of a sitcom.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s the classic blunder. I mean, if you\u2019re doing the thing of pretending to be on the phone call to avoid have conversation with somebody - by the way, as far as that goes, who among us can throw stones. We\u2019ve all done that. But classic blunder, is claiming you\u2019re on the phone with someone the other person might know - or in this case, at least, know **of.** So you wanna be more vague than that.\n\nAnd if thousands of people weren\u2019t having their lives destroyed right now, the incompetence would be amusing. But instead, given the staggering nature of this catastrophe, it\u2019s infuriating, and people are very, very tired of this kind of thing, they want competence to make a comeback.\n\nThat would mean the Los Angeles Fire Department would have to fire some overweight lesbians who are making $300,000 a year, but it would also mean that, the next time a massive wildfire engulfs the city, Los Angeles might actually have **water in the fire hydrants,** imagine that. They might have a mayor who\u2019s on the scene, coordinating a response, instead of pandering in Africa. They might have enough firefighters to put out the blaze.\n\nThat\u2019s a turn of events that outlets like \u201cRolling Stone magazine\u201d desperately wants to prevent. But at this point, it\u2019s looking more likely than ever - DEI has been tried, it has failed in spectacular fashion **everywhere.** And now it\u2019s time for competent people to take over - even if they happen to be white men, God forbid. The residents of Los Angeles may have struggled to understand it up until now, but they understand survival. And at this point, that\u2019s exactly what survival will take.", "subreddit": "Rants"}, "sentiment": "negative"}
{"post": {"title": "Owner of the Sub Here. Why I Created This Sub/Where I\u2019ve Been", "id": "1i2w8oz", "created_utc": 1737053603.0, "selftext": "\nHello everyone, it\u2019s the owner of this sub here. I know people have been wondering where I\u2019ve been for over two years and have many questions, so I\u2019m here to answer all questions. **If I didn\u2019t answer your question, comment below**\n\n1. **Why I created this sub:** I used to do apps like Instacart, Door Dash, and Spark all the time since 2020. During those early COVID years, I entered the gig life as an alternative to the 9-5 and saw potential. History repeats itself all the time. When I was in the Instacart sub on an alt account in 2020, people would always say to stop posting your earnings as it would cause the app to get oversaturated, meaning less work for us. Instacart became oversaturated by 2021; however, this wasn\u2019t because people were posting earnings, this was because Instacart went out of their way to run active adverts to get people to tune into the Instacart platform. In 2021, I saw the same thing with the Spark subreddit, with people saying \u201cyall are going to ruin this app.\u201d Just like Door Dash and Instacart, Walmart ran adverts for their \u201cgrocery delivery service,\u201d meaning that they advertised Spark really hard in 2022. A lot of people on Reddit forget that Reddit is not the only social media platform and forget apps like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram exist. Redditors on Spark were blaming other Redditors for Spark becoming oversaturated when that was far from reality. In 2022, I explained to users in the Spark sub that Spark would become over saturated not because of Reddit, but because of Walmart ads and other social plats and that there was nothing anyone could do about it. A lot of people didn\u2019t believe me although this happened to Instacart in 2021. Since I understood that posting earnings wasn\u2019t actually going to oversaturate the market, I made this subreddit as a way to rebel against r/Sparkdrivers\n\n2. **Where have you been for two years since this place has been unmoderated?:** I actually got a 9-5 again in 2022. I knew as far back as 2021 that eventually I would have to return to a 9-5 at some point. Here\u2019s how I knew and what led to me eventually going back. In 2020, I relied heavily on Instacart and Door Dash. Unfortunately my area became over saturated on those plats, so I started going to different markets to make money. By 2021, Instacart and Door Dash pay had drastically dropped and those other markets started becoming even more over saturated, so I started multi apping. I think at one point I had 7 apps? I noticed in 2021 that every time I went to a market on an app that wasn\u2019t over saturated and you could make a penny on, it would become oversaturated and be worthless months later. By late, every app in my area, surround markets, and markets over 40 minutes away were completely over saturated. It didn\u2019t matter if you multi appear anymore. What sucked is throughout 2022, I saw the decline by a month by month basis, seeing my earnings go down slowly. It got bad to a point where multi apping, staying true to 1.50-$2 a mile, and making a hundred dollars a day wouldn\u2019t cut it anymore. I ended up working more hours by August of 2022 than a traditional 9-5 just to cut $70 multi apping in various markets that were over saturated. By August, I knew it was the end of my gigging days\n\n\n3. **What I Do Now:** I\u2019m so glad I left the gig life, but I\u2019m also upset that I wasted all those years gigging. I now make more money than when I was doing gig apps and make more money than when Spark was a good app in 2021. I have a job that\u2019s paying for my vacation trip next month now, and I\u2019m not worrying one bit about expenses. I have also started going back to school since 2023 and my YouTube channel has grown a lot in the last year. Since I left Spark, I ended up being able to afford a house and do a lot more things that I wasn\u2019t able to do when I was in the gig life. It\u2019s so weird too. When I was doing the gig life, everyone was so negative about sharing their earnings, but everyone at my job is so open about their checks. It\u2019s crazy because everyone at our job makes more than most Spark drivers and gig workers too. I never knew an industry that could cut worker earnings every month, and instead of the workers protesting against it, the workers become even more volatile to new users and other workers. This is exactly what the gig industry is. Seeing everyone get so hostile in 2022 over new drivers, veteran drivers, etc was so bizarre to me. Since I left the gig industry, I\u2019ve improved my life drastically. I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to rely on such a shitty model of business anymore. I recommend everyone to leave these platforms and actually learn new skills and such to better your financial situations. There\u2019s a ton of free resources that helped me out. There\u2019s hiring manager YouTubers that teach you how to make a proper resume and teach you resume mistakes most people make. There\u2019s also these same YouTubers that teach you how to ace interviews for companies that are paying a good wage for a higher position. You can even be like me and talk to these managers to learn more to help you in getting a promotion. I have accomplished more since leaving the gig field in my life, than I did all those years in it. \n\n\n\nI will say this, yes I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s some hate against this subreddit, with people blaming this subreddit for a part of the over saturation. It\u2019s funny because I made this subreddit when the platform was already over saturated. I don\u2019t know how any of y\u2019all are willing to work more hours and do more work on these platforms to supplement the earnings decreased over the last several years. I\u2019m telling y\u2019all, learn negotiation skills, interview skills, and resume skills and y\u2019all can get yourselves in a good paying 9-5 position that doesn\u2019t involve no bullshit. I thought years ago that \u201cit\u2019s impossible for someone like me\u201d to get where I\u2019m at, but after learning how, it\u2019s so damn easy. \n\n\nAny questions, comment away ", "subreddit": "SparkDriverEarnings"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Heartbroken and freshly 18 I decided to sign up for Tinder, worst mistake of my life. For two months I flopped back and forth in other men's beds, hoping it would help my aching heart. Eventually, during early fall I was swiping on Tinder and saw this 27 year old; his name was Wells, he was white, blonde, bearded, and had glasses. I decided to give him a chance, someone else to add to my roster of ever growing people. Although differently on his profile I noticed he went to the same college my sister attended to, I frequented there alot with my sister. So on a random afternoon I ask him to come out and see me on campus. My first time meeting him I didn't even want to walk up to him, it was so weird meeting a person in a large social setting(cafeteria). Eventually we sit and we start a conversation about a variety of topics. School, work, and our own personal lives which for once didn't feel like a chore to get into someone's pants. I loved our continuous conversation, he was intelligent and quick witted. Eventually some time passes and we go out again just for coffee. And some part of me starts liking Wells, more than just a body more than what I summed up older guys to be. Well's 28 birthday rolls around and I end up taking him out lunch. It was the most intimate thing I've done with another person, even though my sister was there. Although we became more intimate, \"sleeping\" in his car together after his classes and mine. This continued for a month till, one day in his car I ask him if he would ever date me. Breaking the news he said no, he told me I am a sweet girl but I am just not up to his standards. Sobbing in his passenger seat stuffing my feelings down I told him that's okay and, that we will just stay friends with benefits. As another month passes we grew closer, walking around the colleges(we go to separate colleges) holding hands and kissing. Sometimes he would put his hand on the small of my back. I adored this attention because, not only did I have his full undivided attention I felt loved. Wells would open doors for me and never let me pay, some days he would just listen to me rant. He even encouraged me to go to therapy, we shared such intimate times together. One day I went over his house and we showered together. Another time I had a breakdown during a class and he came driving to my aid to hold me while I cried in his car my the lake, later that day I took a nap in his bed. Wells was my entire world and for three months he felt like a boyfriend to me. People would alwas assume we were a couple in public because, of how we acted with one another. Not only that gentle love, he gave me amazing sex, although he wanted me to call myself racial slurs(I am asian). It turned him on, made him happy snd if he was happy so was I. Though things started to turn sour during October. One night my sister decided to rent an Airbnb, I invited Wells over to stay and come with my sister and I including her friends to the club. I got absolutely hammered that night and was all over him at the club. Making sure I flashed my bright pink thong to him under my black mini skirt. When we arrived home we immediately got \"busy\" I was extremely drunk and cannot remember that night. But, I do remember he wanted to have sex around 5 am before he went to work. Later that morning I woke up with him gone to work and me with a raging headache. I went to use the bathroom and notice my thong really wet, it wasn't just from my period which I was on for only three days. Two days later my period ends earlier than expected and I thought nothing of it. Weeks go by I still see Wells regularly for sex, but we made boundaries to not hold hands in school anymore to rebuke and allegations of us dating. During those weeks I get extreme cramps, my boobs start to enlarge, and I start eating alot. This made me assume I was just gaining weight from the food I ate so I started to eat less. Though this didn't stop me from drinking, vaping, and partying. Eventually me and Wells stop sex for a week so I could test if I was pregnant because it's already been past October since I had my last period. Low and behold on a Saturday morning the test comes back positive. I cry on the toilet while my sister consoles me, later I end up calling Wells crying between my words. We never used a condom and always pulled out,  I was scared of birth control changing my hormones so I never got on it. We knew this was dangerous so in the end we always opted for an abortion if the worst was to happen, and it did. Two days pass and I go see him to make plans for an abortion the next week. The week of the abortion comes up and he comes with me, luckily the nurses told us that it was still early only a clump of cells 6 centimeters. Our nurse says it was conceived on October 6 or 7, that was the night we went to the club. We stare at we eachother for a second as the nurse leaves but, before leaving she hands me my ultrasound. A photo of a  small sac with 6 centimeters of cells, a fetus. The nurse comes back in hands me the abortion pills and sends us on our way home. Wells takes me to my favorite bakery allowing me to pick out any pasteerie I want. In that moment I felt like I had a family, his hand in mine and a baby who wasn't gone yet. He held me and spun me around I the bakery, for that one second I felt like I was really his. We eat then start out drive home, the next few days are grueling for me. I am having horrible cramps extreme pain and on the Friday of that week I start vomiting purfusly(a side effect of the abortion). Later that night I call Wells and I hear a soft giggle in the back. I think nothing of it and brush it off as he says he is busy and he will call me later, he never did. The next few days he is distant, no late night calls and hardly any texting. On our way to our check up appointment the next week, he tells me he has met someone. I started to cry uncontrollably, he proceeds to tell me she is dating someone. He told me they met through his best friend and that they went out that day to just to hang out. Towards the night they got drunk and ended up in his back seat making out, it was the same night I called him. As Wells tells me all of this I am sobbing and asking him why not me. I ask about her and why he likes her, he says he knows what she wants, they like the same music, and their conversations and never dull of unintelligent. He pulls over the car to an empty parking lot, I immediately bolt out of the car and lean on it sobbing holding my stomach. He gets out and walks to me offering me a hug and I yell at him to stay the fuck away from me. After as soon as this happens a guy in a car passing by tells him to make sure he treating me good. Him and I stand in silence as the sniffle and wipe my tears. I wonder why couldn't it be me, his pregnant teenage friends with benefits. While we are almost there I take a nap from he exhaustion of my fit of rage. After an hour we go inside as we wait I hold his hand and dig my nails into him, squeezing his hand in anger. Once they call us and we sit down with the nurses they examine me again. Showing me my ultrasound they say I passed the baby. I stare at Wells empty, on our way back home I am continually crying and quiet. Crashing out in a In In Out parking lot in the back of his car. Begging and pleading to him why couldn't he love me just the same as her. Later two weeks go by, dry texts no calls I made a decsion to cut him off officially. We have tried to before but always came back together but now I knew he would never be mine, I cut it off in a letter. Blocking his contact but still showing up to the school hoping he would look for me. I hoped he would reach out to me holding me in his arms again apologizing for hurting me. He never did. I contact him right before December starts and tell him how much he hurt me. Everything he did with that girl and the distancing, I am crying at the airport on call with him. I ask him if he kept seeing her and he said yes, she kept cheating on her boyfriend . She eventually told him and he still took her back. During my trip to ease my pain I started to drink everyday, and every day I drank I texted him. How I am better than him, I am getting over him, and that he was nothing to me all lies. The day I come home I call him, apologizing to him and asking about the updates of his life. Wells proceeds to tell me he is still seeing her and in a fit of rage I yell at him. Telling him how could he do this to another person that just wasn't me but someone he doesn't even know(the girl's boyfriend). I tell him about my experience cheating back in middle school to highschool. I told him no matter what me and that guy always got together even during covid. Stunned by what I had to say about his actions he hardly said anything. We didn't talk till new years when I reached out to him. He responded then a week passed I contacted him again no response, I contacted him again and he responded. We decided to meet up for coffee. We see eachother and silence, I couldn't look at him. It broke me to see him to talk to him, I couldn't even hold him anymore for his comfort. We went into his car because is started to cry again. It felt weird being in his passenger seat again, we talked for a long time. I told him how much he hurt me the people around me and people he doesn't even know. All he could do was apologize, we ended leaving the parking lot to walk around stores. And in a Barnes and Nobles I being to start crashing I tell him how immature he is, how he groomed me to be perfect for him through his actions of affection. And how the girl he is talking to is too young for him she is 22. We end up in the back parking lot, I cry again. Telling him how someone else now has to clean up his mess he decided to run away from. How no one will hold him responsible for what he did but congratulate him, because he helped me get the abortion. As for me I am stuck labeled forever as a teenager with an abortion a harlot, nothing more than his whore. Yet after all I said to him all he could do was apologize to me and I still accepted it, I still forgave him. Driving me back to my car we sat in silence and is that parking lot I cried to him to stay. He kept leaving and walking away form me because he knew it hurt me to be in his life. I told him it hurt more when he wasn't in it, when he didn't say anything to me. I had no one to turn to, I felt abandoned by him. Even though we never dated my feelings for him lingered, I loved him. Wells ended the conversation with a compromise that he will stay but with limited interaction. And holding on to anything I accepted. He walked to my car and I asked him for a hug. I cried in his arms clutching him while I shaking. His hug felt so lifeless and cold, nothing like when he used to hold me. Eventually I texted him and he hardly said anything. To stop myself from the yearning of him, I told him that if he wished to talk to me he had to first. And if he wanted my forgiveness he would have to change who he is and really show me that change. I'll never forget him, he was the father of my aborted child who I still love dearly. My actions play a part in all of this too. I just wished he would have changed.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

A lot of times I can't form words or swallow, or breathe, and then things start spinning and It's like I forget how to do anything but blink. At its worst it'll feel like a bolt of lightning shoots across my brain from front to back, and I'll temporarily lose my memory of what's happening around me (ie. where I was, and who was around me).\n\nIt used to come around quite a bit (every month for 1 to 2 weeks at a crack). Nowadays it's not as much, but when it occurs, some days and weeks are more (or less) intense than others. I'm unsure what triggers might be, but my partner says they notice it coming on more often when I'm stressed or we go into certain bright buildings. (It can still occur in dimly lit or dark places, or with my eyes completely closed too. My eyes will still try to \"blink\" when closed or trying to sleep).\n\nWhen it happens, I twitch and move my body like I'm tweaking off something. The only temporary relief I've found is to close my eyes, and apply pressure to my upper neck. The main thing I've noticed, is If the \"Blinkies\" (as I've named it) are about to come or are currently happening, I, for the life of me, am unable to crack my neck until it's gone after a week or two.\n\nI've gone to my doctor about this a few times. They don't seem to take me seriously and dismiss it as a migraine and send me on my way. If memory serves correct, I pestered them enough once to get them to do a brain scan and nothing showed.\n\nThis whole thing is really messing me up and I'm scared of how much worse it can get. I just want some help from someone who will look into it or talk to me for more than 2 minutes and then send me home, but I don't know where to go/who to talk to that will take me seriously. It could very well be a migraine, but I'd feel better about that answer if they looked into what else it \\*could\\* be when I asked.\n\nAny advice on where to go next, or what to do would be appreciated.\n\ntldr; Got a vax, now I've got pressure in my head with excessive blinking to the point where I can't drive. Feels like lightning hits my brain then I'll get dizzy, occasionally forget where I am, how to speak and how to swallow all while a light headache and excessive blinking. Got a brain scan once, showed nothing. Doctor says its a migraine but won't look into it any further.

There were a bunch of Nelnet loans that have now been discharged due to the school's closure. This was a private institution, well regarded for certain programs and charged a premium price for it (through covid restrictions, they continued to charge premium price but could not deliver a worthwhile remote education). \n\nThis school worked out agreements with several local Community Colleges to accept their students. Wife settled on one and was accepted by default due to the agreement. Unfortunately, she was eligible for less financial aid - although she did get some money through Nelnet - and we were forced to go private (make too much for assistance, but not enough to really afford tuition outright). \n\nSo this CC was paid quite a bit by college Ave AND Nelnet. My wife was able to finish a semester and then ended up withdrawing because the program was really lacking and she had some health issues related to pregnancy.

My wife had always envisaged having girls, and has always wanted girls, and has found this a massive struggle. She thinks that the pregnancy we terminated was a girl, and wonders what if that was the only chance she\u2019ll get.

She has kind of rallied and we ordered quite a lot of stuff last week, which I thought was her being able to deal with it, but she still cries about it every day.

I was looking forward to doing all the baby things with her, and slightly feel like I\u2019m missing out. A tiny part of me is upset with her for thinking this way, and wants her to just get over it. And I feel terrible for thinking that way, I know it\u2019s wrong, and that she\u2019s going through something awful, worse than I can know, but it\u2019s still there in the back of my brain \u201cget over it, it\u2019s still our child, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is\u201d and then I bury that thought, as I know it\u2019s not helpful.\n\nShe is talking to the perinatal team, who are referring her onward for more support from a therapist, she\u2019s also talking to a local charity who are supporting her and we have a private midwife (we made the decision to go with one after her previous pregnancy, and she\u2019s been an absolute godsend) so wheels are in motion for that, I just wanted to find out if it was uncommon, or if there was more I could do to support.\n\nI\u2019m just looking for advice really, has anyone gone through anything similar? Did it work out for you? I know the answer is probably talk to her, but she\u2019s got enough on her plate right now, and she probably already knows about how I feel and that\u2019s adding to her guilty feelings. Generally, just not fun times for us right now.\n\nIt\u2019s been good to write it down and collect my thoughts on it, even if no one responds and I\u2019m just hooting into the abyss.\n", "subreddit": "daddit"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Then, I was placed in forbearance in August 2024 where the letter states that \"no interest will accrue while on forbearance.\" However, January of 2025 there was an accrual of a total $1,089.41 (*+$749.70 since July 2024*) in interest without any documents available to explain this accrual. I had recently paid off a portion of my loan including the interest in\u00a0question, so the current value is at $0.\n\nAdditional information: There has not been any interest accrued on my account since the COVID-19 emergency relief for federal student loans, and the documents show as such. The student loan interest relief was extended multiple times, and the documents show as such (no additional interest accruals). No further documents are available after July 2024 due to being placed in forbearance.\n\nI ended up calling Nelnet, and the first phone call end up with the rep putting me on hold for 30 minutes, and then just hanging up. Bummer. The next representative\u00a0was super patient but she stated that there was over $700 of interest accrued showing from their end of the line, with no documents that they can provide me, and the only thing she could do was send my account to be reviewed. She shared that someone will contact me after reviewing my account.\n\nIn the end, I would just like to know where the accrual of interest came from when all available documents show and state that there shouldn't have been an accrual. If there are documents to explain this, I would like to have them available to me. If not, I would appreciate it if we can receive back the extra payment we made (the *+$749.70*).\n\nBut does this make sense to anyone?

But I feel blessed the wait isn't as long as it prob has been for others\n\nTo my delight I learned at the end of last year they were starting a podcast with Ben Stiller and Adam Scott that goes over the show. I am about 3 1/2 episodes into it and I'll be honest I'm a little disappointed. The first ep was cool when they discussed the development of the original idea and how they shot during COVID but after that it seems a little flat. I thought a show with Ben Stiller and Adam Scott would be funnier. And I am getting a little tired of the Hollywood schtick that everything is \"amazing\" and every actor is \"brilliant\" and it is \"so great\" and every scene is Ben Stiller's \"favorite\". I know its a promotion vehicle for the show but a little honesty about difficult moments and maybe a critical eye of the series would be nice once in a while. To anyone who's listen to all the episodes so far: Is it al like this? I want to hear more about the show but if its just actors gassing each other up the whole time idk if I want to continue.

Medical appointment and first document check at the Embassy. Scheduled at least 21 days prior to the interview\n\n2. Interview day\n\n**Medical Appointment:**\n\nThe first thing I did after getting my interview letter was to complete the form on the Unidad Medica website to schedule my medical appointment. They called me one day later and scheduled my appointment for the 7th of November. \n\nFor anyone interested, I asked them if they provide Covid boosters. They said they do but only on Wednesdays (this may change later on so always double check with them). I ended up getting my Covid booster and flu shot at my local healthcare center (CAP) for free, but if that is not an option for you just know you can do it with them even if it's not listed on the file on their website. I think they said it's 30 or 35 euros but once again double check with them. \n\nOn the day of the medical exam, I arrived at the Unidad Medica at 9:45 for my 10am appointment. After I checked in they took a picture of me and then told me to sit in the waiting room. I ended up waiting until 10:30 to be called by the doctor. He went over how the whole process works and then asked me some basic questions and did a quick health check. After that he sent me to another room, where two nurses checked my vaccination certificate and gave me one shot I was missing and then they took a blood sample. After that I paid for the exam and headed to another clinic where the X-Ray is taken. This first part took about 1hr. When I got to the other clinic they gave me a short form to fill and sign, and then I waited around 15 min to be called by one of the technicians. The X-Ray process was quite quick, and afterwards they made me wait and then gave me a CD with my X-Ray in an envelope. You are supposed to bring it with you when you enter the USA. The whole process took 30 minutes more or less. \n\nAfter that, I went to the Embassy, which is a short walk away. I had to show my passport to the officers outside and then I was let in. After going through security, there are some photo booths where you can take passport pictures for 8 EUR if you need to. Once inside I got called to one of the consular booths, where the officer requested some of my original documents, which were my marriage certificate, birth certificate and my home country's police records. She put those documents in an envelope and said I had to bring it with me on the day of the interview. That's all for the day. \n\nAbout one week later I received an email from the Unidad Medica confirming that my medical exam was completed satisfactorly and sent me the updated list of my vaccines and the results of the blood test. \n\n**Interview Day:**\n\nOn the day of the interview, once I was at the Embassy, I was given a paper with a number and sat down in the waiting room. My number popped up on the screen within 10 minutes and I went to one of the booths, where the officer asked for my passport and the envelope they gave me the previous time. She checked all the documents that were in there, then she told me to sit back down and wait until my number popped up again and that's when I would be having the interview. After sitting back down, I had to wait an hour to be called again. I was a little nervous as I walked up to the booth but the officer that interviewed me was super nice. First he made take an oath and then asked me some simple questions like:\n\n\\- Who is the petitioner?  \n\\- How did you meet?   \n\\- When did you get married?  \n\\- Does the petitioner live here in Spain or in the US?  \n\\- Were you able to visit each other after getting married?\n\nAfterwards, he double checked all the documents and after a bit he said: Congratulations, welcome to the United States! :)  \nHe handed me my original documents back and a paper with some info and then said it would take around 2 weeks to get my passport back. The interview was around 10 minutes and the process in total took 1h30.  \nI checked the status of the visa on CEAC later that day and it said Administrative Processing. One day later it changed to Issued. \n\nI chose to go pick up my passport at the Correos in Madrid, otherwise you have to choice to have it sent directly to you to your home address. The passport was ready for pick up 6 days later, on the 16th of December.   \nI entered the US a few days later, the process at the POE was smooth and I didn't encounter any issues, they brought me to another area where they stamped my passport and asked for my number and address and that was it. \n\nSo happy to be finally done!! I know how frustrating this process is, and I hope this post was at least helpful to some of you. Best of luck to everyone!!!", "subreddit": "NationalVisaCenter"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I lost all my friends, there was only one girl with whom I socialized, and at school I was a \u201cquiet kid\u201d. I always had a hard time making friends because of my insecurities. It appeared because in junior high school I looked like a boy and ugly, my classmates told me so, I had glasses that distorted my eyes, crooked teeth with something like braces and acne from a very early age (since about 10 years old, probably...). \n\nI was made fun of a lot in high school, even though I looked better than I used to. Guys told me that I was a beautiful girl, but it was fun for them to make fun of me, once I cried and my closest friend said that I was very beautiful, but I just had this face that seemed to provoke others to tease me somehow, even she found it hard to control herself. Because of this I got anxiety, every time I did a presentation, someone would make jokes at me, try to get me emotional. \n\nNow I have terrible problems with public speaking at uni, I just start stammering, I'm afraid to say a word, when I see people in front of me I feel like everyone is judging and hating me. I don't have any friends at uni, I'm ashamed to even try to talk to anyone, I'm afraid that I'll be laughed at again. \n\nA year ago I had a big group of friends, we often went out together, went to events, but I always felt like a stranger among them, I liked them very much, and they took the initiative to communicate, but I always had a fear that they will choose each other and not me. One day we all got drunk and I said that I think like I am a stranger to them and that I just shouldn't be here, they started to calm me down and said that it wasn't true. But after a few months this communication slowly started to deteriorate and now I have very little contact with some of them. \n\nI have never had a relationship in real life, although I communicate with guys a lot online, but this communication never moves into real life. I am so tired of this, how can I find friends, maybe a boyfriend? At university I started communicating with one guy, at first I wanted to just be friends, we went out for a walk together a couple of times, but one day he did something that was not very pleasant for me, after this incident I felt very awkward, and as I understood, he did it because he thought that I liked him as a guy, which is not a lie, but what he did was unpleasant and even painful, after that day we almost do not communicate, he said many times that he is sorry, that he has mental problems, and he is not always able to immediately assess his intentions, but now at university he avoids eye contact and no longer invites me to go for a walk.\n\nAs you can understand, everything is complicated. And ultimately, I want your advice. How can I find friends, how can I maintain this connection in the future?

{"post": {"title": "Calcified chest lymph nodes, should I be concerned?", "id": "1i31dux", "created_utc": 1737066914.0, "selftext": "I know that this is hard to judge without my full medical history, but I wanted to ask here because I'm concerned about my current doctor's advice.\n\nI am a 29M (non-smoker) with no significant medical issues. I recently had some hematuria, so my doctor ordered a CT scan and the CT scan found a kidney stone and no other issues in my kidney/bladder. At the same time, they caught a peak at my lungs and saw some calcified lymph nodes. My doctor now wants to follow up on this in a couple of months with another CT scan focused on my lungs.\n\nMy question is how concerned I should be about this given that I have no symptoms and am in a low-risk category? The background is that I started seeing this doctor a month ago, and he seems to want to do constant tests - after my first physical he ordered every bit of blood work imaginable and we found that my WBC was slightly low (3.5 or so). He said \"probably not leukemia but let's check it again in a month to make sure it isn't dropping,\" so then I was waiting to see if I had leukemia and (only mildly) stressed. Then I had the hematuria, so they did more blood work - WBC back in the normal range, and no other issues, so they said it's a kidney stone and sent me home with Flomax. The hematuria cleared up for a few days, then came back briefly, so they did a third and even larger round of blood work - this time my strep antibodies are high (I've had no strep symptoms, but I did have a cold a couple weeks ago). So they put me on penicillin and ordered the CT scan. He also tells me one of my liver enzymes is \"a little high,\" but \"this could be caused by stress, let's just check it again in 8 weeks.\" Then the CT scan shows these calcified lymph nodes, which online says are usually benign, and he tells me \"usually benign, but let's check in with another CT scan in a couple of months.\" Honestly, at this point, the stress of constantly being checked for cancer is interrupting my sleep and exercise, which are probably more important to my long-term health at my age. Until I saw this doctor I was completely healthy, now all of a sudden I have more appointments and tests than my parents, and they're in their mid-60s. All the while, my only actual symptom has been the hematuria, which was adequately explained (and confirmed by the CT scan) by the first guess anyone would have had: kidney stone. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to ask here (I also asked my doctor but haven't heard back yet) about how concerned I should be, and more clarity on what might be concerning about these lymph nodes, because I've lost a little faith in this new doctor. He seems to want to test everything all the time, and then re-test everything that falls even slightly out of the normal range. So I don't want to be pig-headed and ignore an important warning sign, but I also don't think I can live my life getting CT tests and blood work done every few weeks when I have no symptoms! Basically, I would like to hear opinions from the docs out there about whether my doctor is over-reacting.\n\nAlso, are there any good questions I should be asking him about my CT scan? All he said is that the radiologist \"noted there are some calcified lymph nodes on the left side.\"\n\nThanks a million.", "subreddit": "AskDocs"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

One started first (Nala) and then the other stopped eating for a bit  (Luna) and got the same poops. \nNala had a round of panacur and penicillin which did help the poop for a week or so after finishing treatment but then it came back after luna started with her symptoms. Luna also had a round of panacur which got her to start eating again but then she started with the poo problems a week after treatment. \n\nWe did a 3 day pooled stool sample for Luna only as Nala\u2019s insurance was void (it started within the first 14 days of the policy). It came back all clear for parasites and bacteria. The vet told me they\u2019re both healthy also tested for T.feotus but I\u2019m sceptical. \nThe vet wasn\u2019t great and didn\u2019t give any advice aside from saying it\u2019s probably a virus and I could try a food trial. \n\nI had a second opinion vet visit today where I planned to ask for a retest so I can fully rule out parasites. However, the vet told me that my first insurance claim hasn\u2019t been approved yet, and I told them that lunas symptoms started on the 17th.  Her insurance started on the 3rd. Depending on how they look at it, it\u2019s either day 14 or day 15. I think it\u2019s day 15 because the 3rd is technically the first full day. But insurance is slippery and they could try everything to avoid paying out!!\n\nThe vet checked Luna over and took her temp. She\u2019s gaining weight sufficiently, hydrated and had no temperature. They\u2019re both otherwise happy and healthy kittens. \n\nBut i have no explanation for the poops and can\u2019t afford to do any more until I know the insurance will pay out! The vet told me to wait and see another whole month \ud83d\ude2d I\u2019ve been cleaning and disinfecting like crazy in case it\u2019s anything contagious and he told me to continue as they could clear it themselves if it\u2019s a virus.

I can\u2019t enjoy my time with them because I\u2019m exhausted. I buy them new toys and wonder if I\u2019ll have to throw them out or if it\u2019s another thing to add to the cleaning list which is already as long as my arm.

I've scoured what seems to be every thread in existence on this bike searching for a similar problem to no avail.\n\nSince the colder months have started rolling in, she has been suffering from a peculiar problem on a cold start.\n\nThe main issue is that when attempting to start the bike, the starter motor will just about to begin to engage before cutting out entirely. We are talking no more than half a second of crank before the whole thing stops/seizes up. \n\nI then have to let go of the ignition button, and try again repeatedly to get any sort of response from the starter motor. Eventually, the bike will start to crank and if all the stars and planets align- we will have ignition.\n\nThere is no pattern to how many times I need to hammer the ignition switch before it turns on, and sometimes she starts first time (albeit this is rare).\nI have had some success in starting by bridging the terminals of the starter solenoid with a long screwdriver, but obviously this isn't an ideal fix for daily riding.\n\nI do have a pair of Oxford heated grips connected, but I am confident there is no parasitic battery drain as tested with a multimeter. I also have the bike connected to an Optimate overnight.\n\nI have replaced the starter solenoid, battery Powerline PTX9-BS and removed the clutch lever switch, all of which have had no benefit. I switched from E10 to E5 which has improved the performance somewhat but the original issue doesn't appear to be a fuel issue.\n\nOnce warm and turned off, she turns back over no issues at all.\n\nAs mentioned above, I have searched high and low for a solution to this starting problem but I am completely stumped as to what to try next.\n\nI have attached a video for reference (can't seem to upload multiple videos?), which is a cold start at just above freezing.\n\n\nFor context:\n2005 Suzuki GSF650 K5\n12.5k miles.\nTwo former keepers, in excellent cosmestic condition and has been very well looked after.\nI'm not aware of any major repairs, but I also don't have any detailed service history.\nCompletely stock other than a BlueFlame exhaust and heated grips.\n\nVery grateful for any and all advice with this as I have run out of ideas.

Should a positive catalyst emerge, such as a favorable earnings report, a partnership announcement, or an analyst upgrade, the stock could experience a surge in buying activity. If, for instance, RCAT stock price jumps by 20% or more in a short period, it could force short sellers to cover their positions, triggering a \"buying panic.\" This could result in a rapid price increase, possibly even 30-50% or more in a short time, depending on how many shorts are forced to exit.

{"post": {"title": "Positive Replacement Experience", "id": "1i31dng", "created_utc": 1737066899.0, "selftext": "I thought I would share my positive Mirena replacement experience. I originally had a Mirena placed July 2016. I put off getting it replaced this summer when I should have because I hate going to the doctor, but in December I made an appointment and got the ball rolling for a new one, which was then placed Monday (3 days ago as of this writing). The PA (physician\u2019s assistant) who was placing it (who said she\u2019s had 3 back to back herself) warned me that back to back placement after not having had periods is often more painful because the uterus and cervix become stiff, for lack of a better word. I haven\u2019t had periods, only occasional spotting while I\u2019ve had my Mirena, so I was concerned about how painful this insertion might be. \n\nAbout an hour before my appointment I took an antihistamine (because Midol contains an antihistamine which supposedly helps with uterine cramping), 500mg of naproxen (generic Aleve, research is showing naproxen works better than ibuprofen for IUD insertion pain), and 2 Robaxacet pills (available OTC in Canada, but not sold in the US, it contains 500mg of acetaminophen in each pill and 400mg of methocarbamol, a muscle relaxer which is available by prescription here in the US). I was wildly anxious for my appointment. My blood pressure was 180/92 and they almost wanted to send me to the ER instead of placing the IUD, but I told them I was always anxious for doctor\u2019s appointments and even more so for this one because I was concerned about how much this may hurt, so they went ahead with the removal and replacement. \n\nWhen the old one was removed, she had me cough and I didn\u2019t really feel it come out. When she placed the tenaculum, I felt a little twinge, but it wasn\u2019t painful, even though you would expect that part to hurt badly. The most painful part was the measuring of the uterus, because I could feel when the tool they measure with reached the top of my uterus, but it was just like a severe cramp. Finally, she placed the IUD and it was like another severe cramp and it was all done. When it was done I almost felt euphoric because I was so happy it was done and it hadn\u2019t hurt very much. \n\nAfterwards, I had some moderate cramps for a couple of hours, and by that evening I felt totally normal and wasn\u2019t bleeding anymore. I felt so good I didn\u2019t even take any more medication. The following day I was fine all day and then I had a few very mild cramps in the evening. 3 days out and I\u2019m starting to have very light bleeding, which I suspect is due to hormone fluctuations rather than the IUD placement. \n\nOverall, I was extremely happy with how everything turned out. The PA had me very concerned about how much pain might be involved, and I appreciate her being honest about that, but I\u2019m glad it really wasn\u2019t that bad for me. I think the combination of medications helped considerably, so if you ever visit Canada, pick up a bottle of Robaxacet or the generic equivalent (we get the big bottle at Costco). It\u2019s also great if you put your back out. ", "subreddit": "Mirena"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

It is not my internet connection acting up, it is decent and stable, no problems in other games of any kind, very good ping and all, so I can assure you, that isn't the root of the problem here. Besides that my console is connected the router by cable, so Wi-Fi issues are just not possible.\n\nHowever Master Duel specifically has issues for some reason, these include connection issues, but also other problems:\n\n\\- Full disconnects from a match a few minutes into the game. Happens 10-20% of the time.\n\n\\- Being unable to load into a match. (Sometimes repeatedly!) Happens 5-10% of the time.\n\n\\- Losing match time during my turn while I can't interact with cards or do anything to play faster, as the game takes forever to load/show prompts and stuff like that. Some amount of time is usually refunded, but nowhere near enough to compensate for the delays. This happens close to 50% of the time. This also lost me a few games, since I was not able to complete my plays in time. At times it has gotten so bad that I had to stop playing some combo-heavy decks, because they became practically unplayable. This is also true for interaction hevay decks.\n\nI have also heard other Playstation players complain about long loading times and slow reactivity of the game in general, which should just not be the case on a PS5/PS5 Pro. I assume this ties back into the same issues that I am experiencing, as I have sometimes experienced slow loading times as well.\n\nI have played Master Duel almost since its original release, continue to play it close to daily and it has never before been as much of a technical struggle.\n\nAny other playstation players feeling like these issues are getting worse? How are things on other platforms?\n\nI think some of these issues may also be related to Master Duel's matchmaking and regularly playing against people from vastly different areas of the globe, naturally causing at least \\*some\\* delay. Though really not that much in theory. Maybe the game should consider connection quality for matches to some degree, like before matching people into a game with a connection that the server can just not maintain reliably...\n\nIf anyone has a fix for this on Playstation, let me know.", "subreddit": "masterduel"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Were they going to wait until I complained of other symptoms? did they think I wouldn't care to know because the infertility effects don't bother me? ....what happens next?\n\nSome background. Hi, I'm 30M (trans) and I had a bisalp for sterilisation 5 weeks ago. Today, I finally got access to the letter my surgeon sent to my GP a day after my operation. It's pretty generic since the GP doesn't need all the gory deets, but it mentions a \"small area of endometriosis\" deep near the uterosacral ligament. it also tells them that I don't have a post-op scheduled and I've been discharged back to my normal doctor. the GP has had access to this for a whole month... but there's been no phone call. no discussion. I wonder if they hoped i wasn't going to trawl through my records and notice it.\n\nI'm already pretty fed up since the gynae department also hid the smear test under anaesthetic until the last moment - when I was wearing the hospital gown and about to sign the consent form. they also may have hidden information about a catheter and/or uterine manipulator, and I'm waiting for my detailed surgical notes to be released to me. I'm going to go wild if I find out they used those without telling me.\n\nso them deciding endometriosis isn't worth me knowing either? I wish i could say i was surprised. they didn't take it out, but that makes sense as it's not a huge amount, maybe it was too much of a risk. I don't really care tbh, I know it can grow anywhere in there and it'd probably just come back.\n\nKnowing there's endometriosis in that area though makes a lot of sense. I've had chronic lower back pain and digestive/bowel issues since I was a teenager. I am on two different medications for IBS symptoms. the cramps I'd get back when I used to have periods were more sacral and bowel than uterine or vaginal. It's too bad my GP didn't put the pieces together that perhaps my prescriptions for digestive problems and lumbar physiotherapy might be related to the tissue found which commonly causes.... back pain, cramps and issues with constipation. wow! who could have seen this coming!\n\nI'm not going to bother kicking up a fuss about this tbh. I have CIN3 and a biopsy/LLETZ combo GA operation in 4 weeks time. I'm trying to figure out what they did to my body while I was under, and drafting emails to fight for transparent information for patients who are undergoing similar surgeries. later in the year, when things have hopefully calmed down, I'll put myself forward for a total hysterectomy. \n\nmaybe the GP will manage to make time to call me with this finding. this incurable, often worsening, sneaky clump of tissue hiding in my ligaments. maybe they'll actually do the bare minimum to help me absorb this information and what it means for my life. God knows I'm already struggling with the pre-cancer findings and the psychological toll of not knowing if I, a person with PTSD already, was violated during surgery. with already having to battle my own brain regarding the non-optional smear. maybe they call to even ask if I'm doing okay or if I need support in the wake.\n\nor maybe they won't.\n\njust another thing wrong with my body that gets added to the pile. I'm not wholly devastated by the endometriosis since my pain is mostly \"fine\" and i don't have the grief regarding fertility struggles. but it sure would have been nice for my surgeon or GP to give me a heads up. I don't think there's even anything I can do beyond the meds I'm already on, so... I guess it doesn't really matter.", "subreddit": "endometriosis"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I was doing cooking and doing dishes today, and I noticed an empty coke bottle on the kitchen countertop as I was cleaning.

I cooked tofu yesterday and I didn\u2019t see it fall under the stove until I cooked breakfast today and I cleaned it before I started cooking. I got frustrated and told him he could just say \u201cok i will next time\u201d instead of being petty. He argued with me again bringing up times I\u2019ve been lazy with things but how he never brought it up with me. I admit I\u2019ve been slacking on chores but since the new years started I\u2019ve been cooking, doing dishes, laundry, and doing all the other chores while I wait for my new job to start in february. I also want to lose weight and start my fitness journey so I wanted to be more proactive and pick up better habits. However, my husband hasn\u2019t acknowledged any of it and he just brings up any of the time I didn\u2019t pick up my slack and makes it impossible for me to ask him to do something. We ended up going back and forth and having a screaming match and he shouted he wanted a divorce. I know he does more chores daily than just do, but I feel like I have been doing a lot on my end & think it\u2019s unfair his first reaction is to point out my flaw instead of trying to work with me. I also have been battling some sort of mental health issues (I haven\u2019t been diagnosed) but on days I don\u2019t work, I used to not even have energy to get out of bed besides to use the restroom.  \n\nFor some context, I\u2019ve been together with my husband for almost 8 years. We moved in together and got married 4 years ago. The first year went well, we split housework and chores, and split the rent and bills in half. In the 2nd year, I went per diem on my job bc I went to back to school (he worked a full time job in tech). I contributed $500/ month to rent and bills & eventually had to dip into my savings because I ended up quitting my job. Our rent at this time was $1800 +utilities. For chores, I do laundry, clean the bathroom and bedroom, and usually deep clean 1x month. He does dishes everyday & bought a robot vacuum to vacuum every day. We take turns cooking, but he cooks more. Once I graduated school and got a full time job, we moved and I said I would pay all the rent and utilities bc I felt bad. Our rent now is $2650+utilities, and I\u2019ve been paying it all for the last year. Right now, the chore load is about the same but I\u2019ve definitely been slacking on laundry. I work 12 hr shifts and come home around 8pm so he ends up cooking more. He works a 9-5pm at home. I feel guilty bc I know he feels like he does more chores since dishes and cooking is an every thing, while laundry and my other chores is more of a biweekly- weekly thing. I\u2019ve been doing every chore now since I have a month of being unemployed before I start my new career. He will pay rent for the month I am not working, then I will start paying rent again (or we will discuss splitting it). \n\nHe shouted that he wanted divorce for the first time today, and I am contemplating it as well. We have not been intimate for over a year. I am shocked about him suggesting it, but I also am torn because I love him and want to work with him, but also frustrated and unheard in this relationship. \n\nHave you guys had any similar experience and what ended up happening with your relationship?", "subreddit": "Marriage"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I don't see the benefactor ever recommending getting one or any kind of staff.\n\n2. Are the AI Bad? Currently Difficulty is set to 70, I selected the hardest option when making the save, good to know it can go higher because as it stands, kinda rare im now 30 seconds faster minimum per split, and if so its because I have some random penalty.\n\n3. Shakedowns, is there any reason to do all 5? I understand I get another set for doing one but ive just been doing 1 then starting, all 5 seem pointless.\n\n4. What happens if I select a service option that puts me in the red time? It looks like I can confirm it, I usually try to replace any parts that get damaged, but sometimes the time is really short and I need to do like Exhaust and Body. Kinda scared to hurt the car so I just fully focus on never crashing.\n\n5. Is tuning important? Cars feel fine the way they are, can't imagine thered be a point to do so right now because handling just feels good, I only have to use breaks for hairpins and Ive only locked them like 2 or 3 times? So yea Saw a bunch of threads recommending setups but seems to complicated for someone new.\n\nBonus Question, WHY DOES THE CLASS LEADER ICON DISAPPEAR?

I\u2019ve started this diet around 1.5 weeks ago. \nI\u2019ve been seeing slight progress but what\u2019s really hitting me is fatigue, I\u2019m so tired I can barely get my work done. I used to go to the gym after work last year and now I can only manage to go straight home and rest. For exercise, I\u2019ve been walking ~3miles/day after work but even that has been difficult in the past couple of days. \n\nIs this dip in energy expected when you cut calories? Does it go back up ever? I\u2019ve started taking multivitamins in case that\u2019s something but I feel like it would be very hard to sustain this if energy is this low for months on end.

Last semester, I earned a 3.3 GPA, but during my 1L year, I had a 2.7 GPA in my first semester and a 2.6 in my second. My second semester was particularly challenging because I missed about a month of classes due to a serious car accident\u2014I was rear-ended by a driver going 80 mph.\n\nMissing that much time in law school is almost unheard of, but I persevered and even made the moot court team. What makes the situation even more frustrating is that the whole purpose of 1L is to learn what\u2019s expected of you in the first semester, so you can make the necessary adjustments in the second semester. Unfortunately, my accident prevented me from making those adjustments at that critical time.\n\nThat said, I\u2019ve since been able to implement the changes I would have made back then, and the results speak for themselves. Last semester, I earned a CALI award in one of my classes and significantly improved my academic performance overall.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not common to submit an addendum for a single semester\u2019s grades, I feel it\u2019s appropriate in this case given the unique circumstances. Despite missing an entire month of school, I still managed to perform better than some of my peers, and my upward trend shows the adjustments I\u2019ve made were effective.

It can be as much as 10%. With so many spots already going to kids whose biggest accomplishment is sports, the last thing colleges want is admit even more students who are into sports. \n\nThe bigger problem with sports though is that they are super time consuming. If you play a sport like football, wrestling, lacrosse, or basketball, you will easily spend 20+ hours per week on a sport. That is time taken away from academics and other extracurriculars, and despite what most AOs say, they don\u2019t care much about the sport. They don\u2019t care about the massive amount of time spent.\n\nAt my high school, the kids who did these sports never get into T20s. Never. The ones who did get in did less time consuming ones like tennis or cross country.

The detail, historical accuracy, combination of RTS and first person, etc. But I'm really struggling with how to manage large forces in some of the campaign missions.\n\nTo take as an example, the Ace of Swords German campaign mission at Kursk. I spent 20 minutes at 1/4 team organizing my forces into four groups of infantry with hotkeys, then running them over to the trucks to grab smoke grenades and dynamite charges, setting up my mortars, repairing the broken tank.\n\nThen when the time to attack comes, I have two groups advance down the road towards the first line of trenches under a smoke screen. I also have the repaired Panzer 3 move up a little bit to provide covering fire if possible. Under the smoke, I dynamite the obstacle, and have the mortars drop smoke rounds onto the first line of trenches before running the infantry in to clear them out.\n\nBut wait, now I'm taking fire from the right by an entrenched tank and some machine gun positions. Fine, I advance my other two squads in that direction to take it out. But uh oh, the Panzer 3 from above got a little too close and has now apparently been knocked out while I was dealing with the right flank. And oh no now I need to pivot one of my squads from the first assault to the left to take out a machine gun battery that's now shooting from the left, and I ordered one squad to move up the trenches to flank and take out the big AT emplacement. \n\nBy this time, I look to the right to see that an entire squad has now been taken out by a mortar shell because I didn't tell each individual soldier where to go and they all bunched in the trench. \n\n  \nAnd on and on and on. I just can't micromanage every unit and tell them what to do at every single moment. How do people organize their forces so that they can get things done without having to react to every little thing that happens personally. It's just exhausting and frustrating.

Also tried to be very careful about getting compat patches for everything that needed it.     \n\nThe only thing is I have been guilty of using LOOT and not manually sorting my LO, which I know is bad. But I've had no major issues with it till now. I posted in a modding Discord and they basically told me that I was a terrible person for downloading mods this way and it was an \"Average case of clueless new user with zero idea of what they're doing immediately going to the most popular page and downloading everything\".        \n\n\nThey really didn't provide anything helpful other than the [The Method](https://moddinglinked.com/themethod.html), which seems to be for when you are building a list from the ground up, not when you already have an existing save and list.     \nI did download XEdit and it's evident there are conflicts/overrides with the NewVegasMedicalClinicInt cell, but I have no idea how to go about resolving them. Feeling a little lost. Like I said the rest of the game has worked more or less flawlessly with great performance and all mods working as intended.      \n\nOnce again, I tried to be careful about how I download and what I download for this save, but it's evident I made some missteps like not manually sorting my load order (I may have also had Lone Star and JSUE and it's patches installed simultaneously as I didn't realize they were the same thing, but that has now been resolved).     \nWondering if anyone can help me figure this out and maybe even give me some pointers on how to better manually sort my load order. And please, if you're gonna be an asshole about things please just don't bother making a comment.    \nI'm just an average guy trying to replay FNV for nostalgia's sake, and don't know much about how to mod correctly but want to learn. If possible I'd really like to continue this playthrough and not have to start over as I'm having so much fun with it.      \nRelevant info:      \nCrash is reproducible, always happens after about ~2 secs of the loading screen while entering the clinic.

But there\u2019s a hidden gem I discovered while reading his wife Camille\u2019s book, [\u2018This Thing of Ours: How Faith Saved My Mafia Marriage\u2019](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13257280)\n\n>*When he was in jail, Michael got acquainted with a handful of infamous characters that I had the \"pleasure\" of meeting on more than one occasion. One became friendly with my son. I was talking to my husband through the glass pane at MDC and noticed that Michael Jr. wasn't sitting on the floor by my purse. I turned my head and was horrified when I saw his little behind planted on the chair next to mine and chatting on the telephone with an inmate.*\n\n>*I started to panic when I recognized who it was. \"Michael,\" I whispered, \"our son is talking to Lyle Menendez.\"*\n\n>*Michael seemed oblivious to my concern. \"Oh, that's okay. Let him talk to the guy. Lyle's just waiting for his attorney.\" At that point, the Menendez brothers were still awaiting trial for killing their parents with a shotgun in 1989. They had not been convicted yet, and Michael, with his naturally nonjudgmental character, firmly believed that one was innocent until proven guilty. He saw no harm in our son talking to a criminal arrested for murder. I, however, was uncomfortable about the whole thing. Especially because as time went by, Michael Jr. looked forward to his visits with his \"friend Lyle.\" The two frequently gabbed because Lyle's attorney was notorious for being late.*\n\n>*One day I went to the grocery store with my kids, and there was a People magazine on the stands by the checkout line. The Menendez brothers were on the cover. Michael Jr. yanked my shirt and screamed, \"Mommy! Mommy! Look it's Lyle. There's my friend Lyle.\" Michael jumped up and down and excitedly pointed to the magazine, attracting a lot of unwanted attention our way. The shoppers who stood nearby shot disapproving glances my way. I grabbed the magazine out of my son's hand.*\n\n>*He went into full-on tantrum mode. \"No!\" he shrieked. \"I want the magazine.*  \n*I want to see my friend. I want Lyle!!\" While he continued to stamp his feet and convulse in sheer agony, calling out for his \"friend Lyle,\" all eyes were on me. I wanted to get out of there, and fast.

{"post": {"title": "Weight Gain Issues After Subtotal Hysterectomy?", "id": "1i31csn", "created_utc": 1737066832.0, "selftext": "I, 35/f, have never been a big person. I'm 5'3\" tall and after my children were born, my weight has hovered around 150lbs. I've been a semi-active adult, hiking and playing with my kids, going on leisure jogs, riding bikes with my husband, we aren't ever stationary long. We also eat much healthier than most. While we do indulge in the occasional pizza night or order something like KFC on an evening when we don't feel like cooking, I think our habits are pretty great. \n\nI don't say any of this to do anything except set the scene for my frustrations. \n\nIn March of 2021, I underwent a subtotal hysterectomy to remove my uterus. I had tons of endometriosis that was removed, as well, but was able to keep my ovaries, which is great because I am not a candidate for hormone replacements due to hepatic adenomas I developed in my liver from taking hormonal birth control as a teenager. Surgery went okay and I was healed up in no time. It is important to note, when I went in for my post surgery appointment, I weighed 143lbs.   \n  \nCut to, a year later at my annual check up, my weight jumped drastically. In a single year, my weight went from 143 to 179lbs.  I knew I had gained some weight, but didn't think anything of it until I actually stood on a scale and saw the number. My doctor told me my A1C was really high and did some additional bloodwork, but was told everything came back normal. My thyroid, my metabolic tests, everything was within the normal range and they recommended diet and exercise. I know your body can undergo significant change while you're getting older, so I figured I just needed extra maintenance to get myself back where I needed to be and accepted what I was told. \n\nI took to the gym immediately after, working on cardio and lifting as I did when I was in high school. I was a student athlete, so I knew some routines I could get in to, and did some research online for recommended sets so I could really zone in on my problem areas. After working out March, April and into May, I realized I was having a problem because there was no difference, so I hired a personal trainer.  I worked with him 4 days a week with a 5th reserved for heavy cardio which I usually did early on Saturday mornings. I was consistent, drinking water and eating more raw, whole foods and proteins, being mindful of what I was taking in to make sure I set myself up for as much success as I could.  \n\nWhen my trainer and I met the first time, we did full body measurements. My BMI was at 34.8. He did all of the measurements and took note of everything to compare to in order to motivate me when we checked back on results. 3 months later, we re-did the measurements, where I was told my body composition was changing and so my weight may not, but the rest of my measurements should have. My BMI was 34.7. My weight was still at 179 and none of my body measurements changed with the exception of my biceps and calves each growing by about 1/4 inch. He was baffled but said maybe at my 6 month mark, it'd be better, that some people have a harder time losing weight than others and it just meant I needed to stay dedicated. This was after almost a solid 6 months of being in the gym between 8-10 hours a week, only drinking water and counting every morsel I put into my mouth to ensure a caloric deficit.  \n\nI had another appointment with my PCP to discuss my concerns. She brushed it off, saying as we age, our metabolic system slows down and to just do diet and exercise. When I explained I had been doing the diet and exercise, showing her my app where I shared my meal and water intake with my trainer and where they posted all of my workouts and measurements, she rolled her eyes and dismissed me, saying to just keep at it. I left the office in tears. \n\nI had already scheduled an appointment in late August with my OBGYN who performed my surgery. Entering the room, he took one look at me, then at my chart and he asked me what had changed to cause my weight to fluctuate so rapidly.  While most would find this rude, this physician delivered 2/3 of my children, and I'd been seeing him since I was 14, so he and I had the kind of relationship I would hope every person could have with their doctor: open and honest. I expressed the only difference was the surgery. I showed him the same things I showed my other doctor, and he said I may just need a kickstart to get things going. He prescribed me phendimetrazine tartrate, telling me once I hit my goal weight, I would just need to keep the habits I had formed to maintain because it was a short term medication, but one he had great success with. I trust my doctor, so I began the medicine.  \n\nMy check in with my trainer that November, after taking the medication for 2 1/2 months, my weight was 162 and there was a visible difference. I was so excited! I finished my round of medication, did my appointment with my doctor and was able to be taken off the medicine by December. When I stopped, my weight was at 153. I was able to maintain the weight I was at by staying active and continuing to follow healthy eating and being conscious of my caloric intake. I felt great, my outlook was up, I was super happy things had evened out. \n\nOf course, it can't be a happy ending because why would it?\n\nI developed an issue with my left leg that made lifting or impact exercises for my leg impossible without immense pain. I was diagnosed with recurring tendonitis and it has restricted what I can do. In place of running, I do bikes and ellipticals, in place of lower body lifting, I do things like yoga to assist. While I understand decreasing my activity level could result in weight gain, I didn't realize how quickly or how much. I could feel clothing getting tighter, so I'd increase my time spent on upper body lifting, body weight exercises, even adding an hour or so of walking cardio as a cool down from my workouts. I tried fasting, supplements, changing my caloric intake to a point where I could feel my body begging for more food, but I wouldn't give in. Nothing really seemed to help, but I was still being as active as I could, and I knew there wasn't much more I could do. \n\nIn March of 2024, when I went for my checkup with my PCP, my weight was at 187. I not only gained all of the weight I had lost back despite my consistency, I had gained almost more. When I got on the scale, I cried. The nurse was very sweet, trying to make me feel better, but it didn't help. I was in tears the entire appointment, my PCP shrugging off my concerns yet again, repeating the mantra of \"diet and exercise\" as if I was a lazy person who just wanted a quick fix. I was so irate when the only response I got was \"I'd prescribe you Ozempic, but it's not like that will help because the weight will just come back once you stop taking it.\" and was sent on my way. \n\nMy last appointment, my weight was 184. Not 187, but obviously still much higher than it rightfully should be. I've said in 4 different appointments now to my PCP that a hormone panel or some other testing should be done, because something is not right. There is no way that as active as I am, with the work I've put in and genetically speaking, no other people in my family who are overweight, that I should have my weight being as high as it is. My BMI should not be in the 30s when I'm walking 30 miles a week in addition to lifting weights. \n\nI feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm completely hopeless and am worried my lack of motivation is going to cause further issues. I'm slowly finding myself in an emotional rut because my self esteem is dropping day by day. My doctor doesn't think it's a problem and just ignores my concerns. My gut is telling me something just isn't right and I can't really put my finger on it, but I feel like it can't be a coincidence that all of it started happening right after that one surgery. \n\nHas anyone else had any issues like this after having surgery? I appreciate any responses.   \n", "subreddit": "hysterectomy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I tried therapy (didn't much help and was too pricey) and I went to the doctor about it a few times and was told I show all the symptoms of OCD. was given propranolol but it didn't help much. I constantly worry about how I am perceived in terms of not wanting to be misunderstood.\n\nLately this OCD anxiety has gotten very bad. The problems I've always faced are health based anxiety, usually about heart attacks or dying young from a bad lifestyle, and social OCD where I obsess over my past or embarrassing things. This happens constantly throughout the day, and sometimes results in my blurting things outloud cursing myself for being so stupid or naiive. \n\nThe political climate in the world right now has gotten me really down too. I have fairly strong \"progressive\" values and i find it hard to be diplomatic without feeling I'm compromising those values, and it's a big source of OCD too. When I see the state of the world with climate change, the rise of the far right, the miscarriages of justice, it makes me feel a pit in my stomach and I lose hope for the future, and I obsess. I feel like there's some gulf in my own understanding of the world and others'. I constantly worry people think I'm pretentious or that I'm 'holier than thou' because I hate that shut but worry that the way I express my opinions on this stuff is maybe not that accessible to some. My heart can be so full of anger and that fuels the OCD.\n\nThese negative spirals of thought over even mundane faux pas are relentless and I don't know how to break out of it. For the past few months I've been exercising fairly regularly, which has done nothing for my cardiophobia or mental health. I try to build positive thought reinforcements but my negative spirals are so powerful they just cancel it out. I try my best to be measured in my feelings and responses to politics but then I always fuck it up. I'm doing so much productively but there's this little man in my head constantly waiting to fucking strangle me. It fucks with my self concept sometimes, as these worries and obsessions consume me and make me feel like I don't know who I am, especially since I'm always viewing myself in replayed scenarios as others percieve me. I don't think most would know I struggle with this because outwardly i am the sort of person who doesnt take myself too seriously (I think).  \n\nIt's hard to think of other examples but stuff and it's hard to even put this into words, but this is constantly invading my brain space, and I can't live like this anymore.

Long time lurker and have tried to do as much research as possible but can't quite get a solid answer, hoping to get some advice if anybody can help.\n\nMoving to Japan soon on a Working Holiday Visa.\n\n1st Q: Planned my flight just after my long service leave at work hits so my first 8 or so weeks in Japan I'll be getting a weekly payment (they don't offer a one-time lump sum payment). May just be answering my own question here but from what I now understand, all income whilst in Japan even from outside the country is taxed at the 20.42% rate - would that include this leave payment? May have shot myself in the foot here by getting double taxed from both countries if so.\n\n2nd Q: DJing at clubs/events. The rules state that working in nightclubs is prohibited, as well as people engaging in entertainment roles, professional sports etc.; would this apply to being booked as a guest DJ? Or what about if the gigs were unpaid/just for fun at private events etc. (no alcohol sales)? Planning on getting part-time work during the day to supplement my travels and definitely do not want to jeopardise any visa stuff for future visits, but it would help being able to play at some events for extra travel money if allowed to do so.\n\nThanks in advance!", "subreddit": "movingtojapan"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

My grandmother passed away almost 3 years ago from pancreatic cancer, and it was brutal. We had a rocky relationship, but a year before she got sick we began to reconnect. Although we were getting closer, she had a lot of resentment towards me for distancing myself for the family for a few years. Before she even knew she had cancer, she one time in a moment of anger told me she would never forgive me before she died\u2014we never talked about that conversation again, even when she was given months to live. \n\nI\u2019ve had several dreams about her over the years, most of them being negative, usually along the lines of my own guilt and shame from the situation, but this recent one was almost comforting.  I was at her house\u2014but it looked slightly different. My best friend was with me, but she didn\u2019t really say anything (oddly enough I had this dream while sleeping at my friends house) we were just standing in my grandmothers living room. I saw someone through the window, standing out in front of the house. I walked closer to get clearer look, I saw my grandmother. She was healthy, I could tell it was her because of her hair, her wearing a maroon sweatshirt, and I noticed her birthmark. She looked the same as I had always known her, before she got sick. I started crying, because in the dream I knew she was gone and why. And then she walked away, to the front of the house. She walked through the front door and into the living room. I was in disbelief that she was there. I asked her what she was doing there, and how this could be happening. We both started crying and hugged each other. The rest of the dream we remained hugging and crying to each other. I apologized for everything over and over, but she said I didn\u2019t need to be sorry, and that she\u2019s proud of me and that everything would be okay.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure how to feel about this.

Hahaha.\n\nI came from a very conservative family na ang daming bawal. I was sheltered. Ni hindi ako nakakasama kahit sa pamamalengke o anything na matatao. Nakakalabas naman ako at nakakasalamuha ko nman ibang bata noon pero nakabantay magulang ko.\n\nPag tungtong ko ng high school dalaga na ako mas lalo ako pinaghigpitan. Bahay school binatasan ako bawal magboyfriend kasi titigil ako sa pagaaral pag sumuway ako. Daddy's girl ako of course nakikinig talaga ako anuman sabihin sakin. Like any high schoolers nagkakacrush at nainlove din ako pero hanggang doon lang. Sunod lahat ng luho ko anuman gustuhin ko pero atrict at masungit ang late dad ko. Bawat salita nya ay batas. Pag nagagalit ako o nagtotoyo itatanong nya lng ano ba gusto ko at nkukuha ko agad. \n\nI dont hate my late dad but sometimes feeling ko ang dami kong di naexperienced dahil sa mga pinagbabawal nya. Mabuting tao dad ko because he really loves our family. Strict siya mahilig mgsermon pero never nya ako pinagbuhatan ng kamay kahit na may pagka spoiled brat ako. Nung mgcollege ako gusto ko sana sa Manila mgaral to be specific sa CEU sana. Hahaha pero alam na, hindi ako pinayagan. Mahirap na dw malayo ako wala dw ako kasama. Lol. \ud83d\ude05\n\nBago ako mgcollege katakot takot na sermon at habilin. Pinapili ako ng course at school wag lang malayo. But heres the catch, pag daw ako nagboyfriend or worst nabuntis tigil daw ako. Hindi nya na daw ako pagaaralin. Iccut off nya ako sa lahat ng privileged at titiisin nya daw ako maghirap. Knowing my father kahit ako ang paboritong anak mtigas ang puso nya once na nagalit. Habang nagaaral ako laging yan ang pangaral sakin at bago magabot ng pang tuition pg bayaran na ito ang linya nya sakin lagi, \"magaaral ka pa ba?kasi kung gusto mo na magasawa magsabi ka lang para di na ako magsayang ng kwarta sayo.\" Hahaha.\n\nOf course i said no magaaral ako. Ganon kami hanggang makatapos ako. And sinunod ko at nakatapos ako awa ng diyos. I'm one of those people na sobrang iningatan ng magulang. Takot silang maaga akong mabuntis gaya ng ibang pinsan ko. \n\nSiguro ito din dahilan kaya late bloomer ako. Late bloomer ako pero jusko hindi ako inosenteng bato na totally zero knowledge about everthing. Before ko madiscover ang reddit wala talaga ako kaalam alam sa sex and anything related. I'm just a lurker at first bago ako maloka sa pagibig at naging hubadera. I'm a wide reader doon lng ako natututo.\n\nIf you know me personally baka pagtawanan mo ko at sabihin sinugaling ako. Even my closest friends hindi un maniniwala na nbsb ako. I have this reputation sa kanila na laging my lalaki, mraming lalaki o hindi daw nauubusan ng lalaki.hahaha. I dont know kung bakit ganon ang tingin nila sakin. Aaminin ko maloko din kasi ako at masayahin. Sabi nila kahit resting b*tch face ako I have this aura na confident lagi ang galawan?

The other members didn\u2019t think it equal so there were enough vetoes to not let it pass. He said at the time that if his trade gets vetoed, he will not do the last place punishment because it was unfair to deny him from competing.  \n\n\nCome end of the season, he gets last place in regular season, but competes in the consolation playoffs and does well.\n\nThe commissioner gets last place after consolation playoffs, because they dropped out and didn't pay attention.\n\n  \nLast Place Regular Season continues to deny that he needs to do the punishment. He also argues that it was never set in stone if it was last place regular season, or in playoffs, to determine who does the punishment.\n\nThe commissioner says it was also never established, so he himself doesn't have to do the punishment.\n\nWe had a league vote where 1/3 of the members participated, after the fact, that said last place after playoffs, should do the punishment. Commissioner says you can't change rules halfway through the season (even though he changed playoff schedule to week 15-16-17 halfway thru, without telling anybody, because he says what he currently had was a mistake).\n\nWhat do you all think?!", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

{"post": {"title": "The new bathroom I never asked for .", "id": "1i31fqu", "created_utc": 1737067062.0, "selftext": "Backstory - we live in essentially a duplex owned by the my partners grandmother , his mom is in the other half . \nWhen we moved in we used the budget to redo his mother's half because although liveable it was dated . This was about 5 years ago. \nHis mother insisted on hiring her friends, who did a poor job and it looks like a hot mess landlord special . The floors aren't under layed so they slide, things of that nature . \nThis house is paid off and is intended to be sold after our child graduates highschool ( 3 years approx from now) . The agreement was that when we go to sell we will move out and remodel our half before it is put on the market.  Now I complain about our bathroom a little because it has ruby red tile floors that clashes the vanity and the tub. But I also appreciate that they are so ugly that a teenager and all her hair inspired antics are causing no harm - because the bathroom needs gutted at the end of our stay, stained with hair dye or not . \nI also keep alot of animals and they are tempature sensitive, not conducive to winter construction. \n**\"Granny doesn't like me\" is probably untrue at this point: I actually come from a  affluent enough family; but she was not informed and accused me of being a gold digger to my face; then turned purple when she met my dad and found out his title. I've just always avoided her after that interaction. I encourage her grandson to be involved but I need not be around people who would treat me so poorly. Apparently she's sorry. \nThe story :\nMy partner and I planned our first ever extended vacation . So exciting . My daughter will be staying with my mother so our place will be empty for the first time since we moved in years ago . \nMy partners mother suggested redoing our bathtub, which I politely \nrejected as the tub is tiled in and you'll half to remove the floor and toilet to do the tub . She said the floors weren't in the budget, so I politely again said don't bother , it all needs done at once so it can wait till we move. She said nothing. I assumed that was the end of it . \nThen my partner starts asking me about vanities and I confused go , we move in 3 years and are redoing the bathroom when we move, why would we buy and store a vanity for 3 years ? \nOh no his mother is redoing our bathroom apparently . Then he asks me to be around for the Plummer to take a look . I am not happy but quiet at this point . \nGuess who showed up all chummy with the Plummer and my heart fell into my butt, if it isn't my partners mother , and clearly one of her many male friends we all try to ignore who says he's a plummer . ( His mother has had more boyfriends since we lived here than I did all of my teens and twenties , and they range from married to parolled to tattoos on their faces. We actively keep my child at arms length with his mother because of her inability to make good choices. There is nothing diagnosablly wrong, she just thinks she can change people.  It is why his grandmother bought a house for two families, so her grandson could intervein on men who were unsafe for her daughter.  ) \nI don't say anything . Nothing . Because if I open my mouth the truth might fall out . They look: the Plummer tells her, \"yup to do this tub that floor is coming out \" ( like she questioned it and thought I was lying or mistaken ?? Ma'am the tiles are stuck to the side of the tub who do you think cleans the grout it isn't your son!) \nHer son comes home and we begin discussing . \nI first suggest we just cancel the project which he says they can't afford to do all the work at the end anymore , they have the money now and his mom wants it done .I said if they had the money they could invest it until it grew to more and could still be done at the end. He just looked at me knowing I was correct. \n\nI suggest he call his grandmother ( the owner of the house ) and have her over see the project . He suggests she's already involved but I find out later that is only half true. \nHe says the budget is low and they will rip out all the tile and put in lynolyum like plastic just like his mom's ; also in all white which is for me -an ethetic nightmare on top of a cheap, bad idea . I say no I think that's a bad idea, it lowers the value of the house you should ask your grandmother ; even though she's not a fan of mine she will agree putting in a well done bathroom will increase the value in the sale More than a lynolyum nightmare. He says the budget isn't there , so I say call her. He eventually does.  \nGranny agrees that taking tile out of a bathroom and replacing it with the cheapest materials is a bad idea, if it's money she will lend what she needs to; so now atleast the plastic walls are out and tiles are in. I have basically been forced into a new bathroom I think is ugly, will be mostly white, and had to call a woman who doesn't like me to defend me about tile. \nI am really unhappy and his mother is acting as though I am ungrateful. But I never asked for a new bathroom . I was happy with the old one and putting in a brand new one for the sale of the house. \nI told my partner and his mother that if any of my animals are impacted by this project I will be very upset as I think this is a bad idea -especially when no one's home and the pet sitter is only here a few hrs a day. \nAm I the asshole ?

There\u2019s no possible way I could make this connection\u2014it\u2019s like Lufthansa didn\u2019t even check the feasibility of their proposed schedule.\n\nAdding to the stress, I\u2019m traveling to attend a **family mourning ceremony** early on the **14th of February** in Toronto. I absolutely cannot be late for this\u2014it\u2019s a deeply personal and important event, and missing it is not an option.\n\nI\u2019ve already contacted Lufthansa, but so far, they haven\u2019t offered me a workable solution.\n\nThis situation is incredibly upsetting because:\n\n1. The proposed itinerary is completely unworkable.\n2. This is a highly sensitive trip, and the added stress is overwhelming.\n3. I believe Lufthansa owes me compensation for this mess\u2014possibly even an upgrade, considering the circumstances.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a similar situation before? Any advice on how to escalate this with Lufthansa or negotiate for better compensation?\n\nAlso, if anyone knows of other airlines that might have reasonable alternatives to get me to Toronto on time, I\u2019d love to hear about them.

My first question is about the scholarship offers for BLS and NYLS. \n\nFor Brooklyn Law, I've received a scholarship of $30,000 for my first year, and will maintain it as long as I remain in the top 85% of the class. For NYLS, I've received a $50,000 scholarship for my first year, however the condition is vague, \"***As long as \\[I\\] remain in good academic standing.***\" I've done some research and know schools often offer predatory scholarship offers through vague wording and insane curves in the 1L year, so I'm suspicious that this offer is too good to be true if it just depends on my maintaining a 2.5-3.0 GPA. In this regard, BLS at least makes it explicitly clear what I need to do.\n\nMy second question is whether I should wait to hear back from schools I've been put on the waitlist for. I was burned by this process by my high school guidance counselor pressuring me to accept an offer earlier, so I went to the University of Scranton though I later was accepted to CUNY Hunter. Scranton's not a bad school and I had a great experience- my bank account cries a bit at my student loans, though, due to tuition.\n\nMy third question is, should I not wait to hear back from SJU and CUNY, which is better between BLS and NYLS? My dad told me that some of the company lawyers at his office say that it doesn't much matter what law school you go to as long as you excel, barring the T14 schools.

Actually, the two often go hand in hand. Think about it\u2014some of the most confident people you know have probably been paralyzed by self-doubt. **But what sets them apart?** They show up anyway.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtu3xgre2dde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=171d8da452c65aa3d748623b28232f1eb79be18b\n\nIf you\u2019re battling anxiety but still getting stuff done, take a deep breath and know this: **You\u2019re not broken\u2014you\u2019re just human.**\n\n# Confidence Isn\u2019t the Absence of Anxiety\n\nSo, let\u2019s throw out this common misconception: confidence doesn\u2019t mean you never feel anxious. If that were the case, most of us would be out of luck.\n\n**Real confidence** isn\u2019t about never feeling fear; it\u2019s about feeling it and still going for it.\n\nHere\u2019s what real confidence sounds like:\n\n* \u201cI\u2019m scared, but I\u2019ll do it anyway.\u201d\n* \u201cWhat if I fail?\u201d Anxiety asks. Confidence replies: \u201cYeah, but what if I don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n# Embrace Both: Anxiety and Confidence\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: you **don\u2019t** have to pick one. You can be both\u2014anxious and confident\u2014simultaneously.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve been asked to give a presentation at work.\n\n* Your palms are sweaty.\n* Your heart is hammering.\n* Your inner voice is screaming, \u201cWhy did I even agree to this?\u201d\n\nAnd yet\u2026 you step up. You deliver the speech. People clap. **Boom\u2014confidence unlocked.**\n\n**Truth bomb**: every time you push through anxiety, you build confidence. It\u2019s like working out. The more you do it, the stronger you get.\n\n**How to Work With Anxiety (Instead of Fighting It)**\n\n# 1. Feel It, Don\u2019t Fight It\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this before, but it\u2019s true: anxiety is like a wave\u2014it\u2019s big and overwhelming for a moment, but it will eventually pass. Fighting it only makes it worse.\n\nSo, what should you do?\n\n* Acknowledge it.\n* Name it: \u201cHey there, anxiety. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n* Let it move through you.\n\nTake a deep breath. Then keep moving.\n\n# 2. Take Small Steps\n\nListen, you don\u2019t need to leap off a cliff to be confident. Confidence comes from taking small, bite-sized steps.\n\n* Start with low-stakes situations. Have to network at an event? Say \u201chi\u201d to the person standing next to you.\n* That small act builds your confidence muscle.\n\nOne step at a time\u2014pretty soon, you\u2019ll be tackling bigger challenges with ease.\n\n# 3. Separate Facts from Feelings\n\nAnxiety is a liar. It\u2019ll tell you things like:\n\n* \u201cYou\u2019re going to embarrass yourself.\u201d\n* \u201cEveryone thinks you\u2019re a fraud.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the hard truth: just because you feel like a mess doesn\u2019t mean you are one. Feelings are **not** facts. So take a moment to breathe and remind yourself:\n\n* \u201cI\u2019ve got this. I am capable, even if I feel like an awkward mess.\u201d\n\n# 4. Celebrate Every Win\n\nYou did it! You pushed through, even when your heart was in your throat.\n\n* **Give yourself a high five.** (And I\u2019m serious about the high five.)\n* Celebrate every little victory\u2014because they all count.\n\n# Remember: You Don\u2019t Have to Wait for Anxiety to Disappear to Be Confident\n\nAnxiety might not disappear overnight, and that's OK. **Confidence doesn\u2019t erase fear\u2014it dances with it.**\n\nSo the next time you feel anxiety creeping in, don\u2019t see it as a stop sign. **See it as proof you\u2019re pushing your limits** and stepping outside your comfort zone. That\u2019s where all the growth happens.\n\n**Now, It\u2019s Your Turn!**\n\nWhat\u2019s something you\u2019ve done recently that made you feel both anxious and confident?

{"post": {"title": "Major slump since mid 2023 - awaiting formal diagnosis", "id": "1i31fo7", "created_utc": 1737067057.0, "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nApologies if this isn't the correct place to post this. I've been ruminating a lot on life since a lot of events and haven't been in a good place mentally for a while now. I've been out of work since Q2 2023, been through a few life changing events, got counselling and on a waiting list to get a formal assessment and kind of sick of the stagnation I've gotten myself into at the moment. \n\n\n\nTo abridge this as much as possible, I had my first assessment for high functioning ASD/Asperger's in 2017, and was told that since I could read facial expressions, I was told \\[quote \"People with autism just can't do that.\" I've since spoken with others that have been diagnosed after this and been told this is not an exact truth, and why I've requested a reassessment. This stemmed from a question I answered about interests which I answered I collected katanas as an interest in Japanese culture and martial arts, and the examiner giving a very obvious look of concern which I responded to saying they were never used, just kept as ornaments.\n\n\n\ngoing forward a bit, I did a few call centre jobs in tech and medical appointments, both of which I hated. I knew my career was in Tech but not a precisely where. I applied to go to Uni and started in late 2019. I graduated 3 years later with a 1st Honours Batchelor degree in Computer Science. I was elated to achieve this, being a child who was held back a year before beginning school and thinking I wasn't far off from being in special ed (and had great empathy for while in the education system).\n\n\n\nI got my first Dev job in summer 2022 at a small software company. I did my best and thought I had a career at the place, but was let go about a year into it with the reason being that the owner wanted to sell up and use my salary to hire a more experienced developer to accelerate this. I had some medical issues directly after this which meant I didn't start applying for new jobs until 2 months after. \n\n\n\nThis is where I started to go majorly downhill. While applying, I got little to no response, which is understandable. I lost a family member who was one of my favourite people in this world. I had to help with funeral arrangements for the first time in my life as other family were also not mentally in the best place. I lost a considerable amount of weight from the stress as well, some comments I got were that I looked 'gaunt'.\n\n\n\nThe week after the funeral, I had to attend jury duty, which was for a child grooming case and heard some details I would have been happy to go a lifetime without hearing. This case went on for a week. I lost another family member 2 weeks after this, and that's when I finally 'broke'. Having suffered bad depression in the past, I recognised my symptoms and contacted my doctor, and have been on beta blockers and anti depression medication since. as the cherry on top, I seen that company who let me go hired another junior developer who had a masters, and just lost all confidence in myself, feeling I didn't do something right or meet an unspoken level of excellence. \n\n  \nI kind of lost a lot of my passions. I stopped playing videogames for about year, only answered friends when they called me, and avoided leaving my home unless I had to for food/necessities. I had a lot of thoughts of 'not wanting to be here' but not going any steps further than that.\n\n\n\nI've gotten a bit better since with counselling and support network of family and friends, but haven't really done a lot of self improvement. I've done a few programming exercises but any that get too difficult, I just have thoughts that \"I'm too stupid for this\" and give up. I know rationally I'm not unintelligent, it's all a learning curve but I'm too scared of putting the effort in to fail again. \n\n  \nI'm nearly 2 years out of work now, my family have said that we should wait for the outcome of this 2nd autism assessment before I return to work. I'm not religious but try to practise Law of Attraction and be grateful for the things I have in life and channel what I want from the future. I rebel this stagnation of wake, coffee, youtube, eat, game, sleep. I just don't have the confidence to give myself the proverbial 'kick up the ass' I need to better myself, contrary to any underlying desire I have, It just feels like I've lost a bit of myself through all of this.  \n  \nJust looking if anyone else has had a similar crazy turn of events in their life that has led to a major slump in mental wellbeing. \n\n  \nThank you if you read all of this, any thoughts you can share are welcome.\n\n  \nLove and light to you all.", "subreddit": "autism"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Im gonna try and keep this in order but more than likely im going to jump around a lot. My bf and I met a little over two years ago. Hes always expressed from the moment we started dating that he wanted me to be a stay at home mom. I absolutley hated the idea, but i didnt think i would be getting pregnant anytime soon so i wasnt to worried about it. Well a couple of months before our 2 year anniversary i found out i was pregnant. Apparently i ruined his life because i got pregnant thats what he told me, not because hes a sex addict that expected to get laid 3 times a day and hated condoms. Thank goodness he only visited me on the weekends cause he lived so far away. Anyways i wanted to see about getting on pregnacy medicade because he was cussing me out for the medical bills he was gonna have to pay. He didnt have to pay anything. I was basically single not married so i got it pretty easy. i know thats pretty messed up, but how he was acting i was thinking he was gonna leave me and i was gonna have to pay that all by myself with shit insurence. I was covering my ass, and i was still working so my taxes weres still paying for it anyways. 6 months down the road and i start working two jobs, first one was my full time job thats was very labor intensive but the second one i got to sit down most of the time and didnt have to lift anything heavy. Well he ends up getting pissed at me for it, kinda understandable im carrying a baby. But it wasnt bad on me at all, yes i swelled like a balloon but my blood pressure was good and i didnt have any pregnancy ailments so i was good to work the 14 hours a day. I wanted to make sure i had some sort of savings so i wouldnt have to depend on my bf for everything like he wanted me to be. Well 3 months later i give birth and about 3 months after that our son is three months old he still wont hold his son. he keeps using the excuse \"im scared to hold him cause i dont want to hurt him or drop him.\" He is a buff man and does have some nerve damage from the military. so i couldnt blame him to much. Im under the impression hes gonna hold him when hes a little bigger. NOPE that was not the case, we are almost 8 months into the birth of our son and he still wont hold him for more then 5-10 mins. That is barely enough time to do the dishes let alone get some time to myself. yes our son does cry for me a couple of minutes in but thats because our son didnt bond with him at all because he wouldnt hold him, feed him, or change his diaper. Our son is almost 8 months old and ive done evrything for him. My bf just works and comes home talks shit to me then plays on his phone and watches tv. He will put any bottles i leave out in the sink for me to do and might clean up a little after me but really only if its in his way or to throw it in my face that he cleaned up after me. Then he used weaponized incompetence saying he doesnt know how to use the dishwasher, washing machine and dryer so he doesnt have to do any of that. He gets mad at me for giving him attitude but i do it for a reason never just out of the blue. He says stupid shit to me like \"oh i was gonna break up with you till you told me you were pregnant.\" or when we first got together he told me i had to pick between him or my 3 dogs. Well i picked my dogs and he ended up staying. Hindsight is 20/20 i should have left him then but i figured if we can come to a compromise about the dogs we would be good. The compromise was the dogs would be outside dogs. I still had an issue with this because my dogs have always been inside dogs. But he said he would get them a really nice shed with heat and A/C so i wouldnt have to worry to much about them being outside, so that made me feel a little better. The things he does that pisses me off is- He always has something to say about everything i do. example: he hates that i dont handwash dishes. he says its a waste of water and electricity even though we have a newer dishwasher that uses like 10 gallons of water, it takes about 20 gallons to handwash. so he is lying to me to get his way, hes a very smart man so i know he know a bunch of shit that normal people wouldnt know. I would have never known how much water a dishwasher uses unless i would have looked it up. And i know him he looked up everything that came with the house so he knows how much everything uses. He just wants to see how much of my life he can control. Im very hard headed so that wont work. Then he said this fucked up thing to me. He said he would kill me for our son, then i told him he wouldnt cause he would have to do something with his son then. He told me i was right and that he would wait till our son was about 5 years old so he wouldnt have to do any of the hard stuff with him. whenever he says something to me thats fucked up he always trys to play it as a joke so if anything happends to me in the next 5 years yall know why. he wanted me to be a stay at home mom but when i need something he get irritated with me like im not supposed to need anything. For Christmas i wanted to bring something i cooked not not something he bought from the store. So i asked him to pick up some potatoes and cabbage that i wanted to make something for the family. Well he told me why would he get that stuff if hes not gonna eat it. Or he will throw in my face that he pays for evrything i get, even if its something i ask him to get for our son not just for me. So i started to buy everything my son and i needed. Well my savings is slowly depleting and hes getting pissed at me for not asking for what we need. Well i do and get fused at for it so i just quit asking. thankfully my bfs mom always makes sure her grandson always has what he needs,  i just dont like asking her cause she helps almost everyone in their family so i try not to ask as much as possible. And she stocked us up on baby stuff for christmas  so i havent had to ask but one time for some a jacket for my son cause he only had longsleeve shirts. My bf has really only paid for jared baby food and some premade formula and literally a handful of toys. But most of everything came from my bfs momma, my momma, or from my babyshower. Which leads to another thing, he hated the fact i had a baby shower. He said it sounds like we are begging. So i didnt want to have one because of him but thankfully my momma made me have one or my son wouldnt have half the stuff hes got. He also told me the first maybe month of dating that i should quit my job and let him take care of me. That was a big fat no no because if we would have broke up i would have just left my job for no damn reason and the probably would take me back. He didnt want me to work a notice he just wanted me to up and leave and not say anything. Back to him not holding his son for a minute, he tells me if i need him to hold our son all i need to do it ask, but when i do he gives me the evil eye. he cant hide how he really feels he hold his expressions on his face so you can tell exactly how he is feeling. He cant hide how he really feels cause his face tells on him. This man has also only changed 1 1/2 diapers. I jumped in half way though so he never finished the diaper change, hes never gives him a bath, never but him to sleep, doesnt feed him and then complains about having to pay for stuff for him. He told me i would have never made it back in the day and i told him lucky for me its not back then. He didnt have anything to say to that. Ive got short term memory loss so im horrible at remembering anything. He used that against me all the time. trying to get one over on me even if he was to lie about it. Like we have a dual shower head that you can cut the water off to one and have a hand held showerhead. well he told me once that i forgot to turn it off so it sprayed him in the face so i beleived him so i would double check and make sure i had put it back to the main shower head. Well i bathed our son and needed the handheld and when i put it back up i made sure i put it back to normal. Well he tell me that night he got home and showered that i did it again and sprayed him in the face when i know damn well i triple checked it to make sure it was right. So hes lying to me, i called him out on it and was persitant that i left it on. When i knoe i didnt, i checked it way more then i needed to to make sure i had it right cause i knew he would either shower when he got home or shower in the morning. he said well someone left and told him it must have been a ghost casue it sure as hell wasnt me. There is probably more that he has done but I just cant remember cause my memory is shit. When our son was a newborn maybe a couple of days old he stayed with my family for the first week of our sons life before he had to go to work again. This motherfucker would be in bed by 10pm and i would be up until my body just couldnt hold on anymore even if our son was sleeping i was so scared someting was gonna happen to him in his sleep i just wouldnt sleep until my body gave out. Well one night i didnt get to bed till 1:30 am, our son woke up screaming his head off thats normal. Well we both get up and i dont know how to make a bottle but i thought he knew how cause hes told me multiple time that hes done this before. I didnt know he had no experience with it cause obviously i was going off what he told. His mom raised his daughter from a previous marriage for the first 4 years of her life when he and his ex were in the military so i should have known that was a lie. But let me get back to the story, well im holding our son waiting to him to do somthing other then stare at me. And i ask do you know how to make and warm up a bottle.he said well its been about 14 years so i cant remember. Well ok then, so i figured it out all one handed casue he refuse to hold his son. And hes just standing behind me agnry as hell cause he had to get up and angrily ask me what i wanted him to do so i responded argrily back saying just go back to bed, well then he proceeds to ask me why ive gotta be a bitch about it. Well i just ball my eyes out cause thats the first time hes cussed at me, im hormonal, in pain from the c-section and holding our son and making him a bottle while his dumbass just watches me do everything. Needless to say my son and i slept on the couch that night so the big baby could get his full nights sleep.   So am i the asshole? Am i not seeing it cause im gonig though postpartum and my hormones are all out of whack cause he thinks it me just being a bitch. ", "subreddit": "CharlotteDobreYouTube"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

{"post": {"title": "Jan 17 - My First LSAT", "id": "1i31fkz", "created_utc": 1737067049.0, "selftext": "Hello everyone! I hope all January test-takers are doing well, or if you're already done, congratulations! I have a question that's been bugging me since I started studying. I feel like I'm a bit too unconventional as a non-traditional student and LSAT test-taker, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.\n\n**Background on me:** I'm a 27-year-old female who speaks six languages. I earned my Bachelor's degrees in Business Law and Business Administration with Honors, along with a certificate in Commercial Real Estate. I also have an MBA with concentrations in Global Business Strategy, Sustainability, and Integrated Healthcare. I've worked for over three years. I've always wanted to attend law school, but I postponed that goal when COVID hit, waiting for a better time. Now, I feel financially secure enough to at least spend a year as a law student.\n\n**My LSAT prep:** I took a somewhat different approach to LSAT prep, and I'm curious if it was beneficial or not. I studied both [Powerscore LR & RC books](https://a.co/d/i7AB4Li), [Ellen Cassidy's LR book](https://a.co/d/hvHmF4q), and the [LSATSimplified ](https://lsasimplified.com/pages/lsat-ebook)booklet. I ran drills on Lawhub but did not take a single practice test (PT). I didn\u2019t take a diagnostic test, nor do I plan to take a PT now. I have test anxiety, especially with numerical results, and I know from my CAPM and GRE experiences that I do better without knowing \"how well I should be able to do\" going in. (I studied for the CAPM for four days and passed with all targets met. I didn\u2019t study for the GRE and received a full ride for my MBA from a highly reputable program.)\n\nI spent 90-95% of my study time on LR, as I've always been strong in RC and don\u2019t feel I need the practice. For example, in RC drills, I haven\u2019t yet gotten a wrong answer. However, I struggled a lot with LR. I have ADD and anxiety, which cause me to second-guess myself and talk myself out of the correct answers. I'm unsure how to handle this for the test tomorrow. I know I can figure out the correct LR answers, but I'm worried about tricking my brain into choosing the wrong ones.\n\n**Additional context:** I started studying in mid-November and have a standing offer from a recruiter at my alma mater\u2019s law school for a full ride if I score above 155. I worked at the law school for a year and know the registrar, some professors, and other staff. This offer motivated me to take the LSAT this year. I plan to apply to other law schools as well.\n\n**TLDR:** Did I sabotage my journey by not studying correctly and not taking a diagnostic test? Should I have focused more on PTs instead of drills? Am I overconfident in my abilities? Should I be worried?\n\nI apologize if this sounds like bragging\u2014that's not my intention. I think I've just been in the corporate world too long and have forgotten how to sound human, lol.\n\n", "subreddit": "LSAT"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

That means that even after EVERYTHING he lost including his brother, after all of the money they just stole, it still wasn't enough for him. I noticed something on the final episode of the first heist. When he and Helsinki are riding in the truck together as they all roam the streets in their disguises, he looks out the window of the truck as if he's planning something, and pushes his glasses up. Knowing what I know now, I feel like that was him already planning the next heist while they hadn't even finished wrapping up this one. During both heists he fumbled more than anyone in my opinion. And if it wasn't for him, Oslo, Tokyo, and Nairobi would still be alive. If he wasn't busy fucking Raquel for 8 hours, he could've earned the crew about the attack. If he had listened to Berlin and eliminated the assassin or at the very least done more than just a pair of handcuffs, Nairobi and Tokyo would most likely be alive.\n\nI plan on making a more detailed post with many more examples one day but I just wanted to hear your thoughts before I write all of that up.

Now, it can be argued he just coached his highly talented team through the most impressive 3 game stretch in college football history, and that is not including wins over top 5 teams earlier in the season.\n\nLooking back at it, maybe Ryan Day was the successor we were crowning Kirby Smart to be all along? Think about it. If (and it's a big if, im personally rooting for Notre Dame) Ohio State is able to finish this and shock the world winning the title as an 8 seed...AFTER everyone here and in the media was saying the program was dead in the water after the michigan game.... the only difference between Ryan day and Kirby smart when it comes to natty count will be a missed 50 yard field goal as time expired. Meanwhile Georgia's offense and defense both regressed badly and Kirby was outcoached thoroughly by the likes of lane kiffin. It was only after several sec teams self destructed that uga backed into the sec title game, only to be bounced in their first playoff game by an injured notre dame team.\n\nWhat a world we live in.

I lost a lot of chances to do things I've wanted to do, since birth, due to health restrictions.\n\nOne thing that got me through all this was this one band (they're called KARD, and I highly suggest you look them up. Any of their songs is a good bet to start with). I've been listening to them since the literal week they put out their first song in 2016, but I've been listening to their genre for well over a decade (since I was about 12). I've always wanted to see them live, and last year they went on tour, but I was still dealing with health stuff and couldn't make it.\n\nFinally, I feel like I'm getting lucky. My chronic health issues have mostly been resolved (knock on wood), and they're going on tour again in October... and I managed to score tickets for myself and my partner. And not just general admission, but the VIP package that lets me have an AMA session, sound check party, group photo, etc. with them... and I've just spent all day in happy tears.\n\nI never thought I'd get this opportunity. It's my top bucket list item outside of the usual things (marriage, kids, etc.). I'm going to be able to look my favorite artist in the face and tell her that she helped save my life. I'm going to be front and center while they sing my favorite song of theirs, that they just so happened to drop when I was in my worst hospital stay in 2019 (being able to listen to that song in there was something I can't explain the magnitude of and how it helped me mentally).\n\nIt was expensive, but I would forever regret it if I didn't do this. I owe it to the scared 12-year-old and 16-year-old versions of me. I just feel like I'm getting to relive and expand upon the actual happy parts of my childhood, alongside how good my adult life has become in ways I didn't think were possible back then.

Then, when I was a young teenager/highschooler every summer the rest of my family would go to a music camp for a week that I wasn't interested in. So I had this one week home alone and it was always the best time. I would usually have some \"party nights\" with friends and some \"treat yourself nights\" by myself. \n\nOn one of these first home alone weeks I had this idea and watched a random hour-long scooby doo movie just for funs and nostalgia. But later during that schoolyear, I remember very clearly, I was sitting in physics and I suddenly remembered that movie. The movie, my week at home alone and the feeling of summer in general, it all came back. And I decided then, that the next summer I would watch another scooby doo movie or at least just a single episode. And after that I did it every summer.\n\nThen, the summer before I was a freshman at college while looking for my yearly episode I found Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated. I watched the pilot and it was awesome. I decided that I was gonna stick to it. For the last couple of years I haven't had these home alone weeks anymore and since I started working, summer isn't all that different from the rest of the year anyway. Still, every year I watch the next episode in line from mystery incorporated and I always have a nostalgic feel-good time with it. But this summer I was so busy that I actually completely forgot about the whole thing and it's only now that I did a double take and realized that I missed my episode. So I'm gonna put that right, right now!\n\nBy the way, of all the Scooby Doo shows on earth, Mystery Incorporated has to be the most inconvenient one to choose for something like this. It's probably the only scooby doo show that has some continuity in between episodes, even if only a little. But I remember almost nothing from the previous four parts, only flashes really. So this whole thing is incredibly stupid. But it's a nice little ridicoulous past-time activity that's only mine and I love it for that. It's like my inside-joke with myself. The fact that I have this small thing is the best. It makes me happy.\n\n(I started when I was 18 btw. If I'm really gonna keep to this, I'm gonna be 44 when I finish the first season.

{"post": {"title": "TIAH because people are kind!", "id": "14qu84k", "created_utc": 1688513214.0, "selftext": "TL;DR: I walked to a store, without a bag, and bought a lot of items. The store had no bags to give me, which I only realized after my purchase, so I was going to have trouble bringing the stuff home. Another customer gave me a bag he conveniently had, as he didn't need it, so that I could safely bring my items home.\n\nI walked to the convenience store today to buy some drinks. I bought four big cans, and I have small hands, barely big enough to carry two in one hand (this is relevant). Usually the cashier bags the drinks right away, but this time he didn't, so once I had paid (they don't charge for bags so it's fine to ask after item purchase) I asked for one, and he said he was sorry but they had run out.\n\nSo now I'm standing there in the convenience store, holding my phone and wallet, four big cans in front of me with no bag. I didn't have pockets either (we're in a heatwave for where I live, 100F/29C approximately, so I was wearing a dress). I realize this was partly my fault and I should have brought a bag with me (which I will from now on!), but regardless I'm in a dilemma.\n\nAn older gentleman was behind me in line, so after a brief pause where I was thinking over my options, I scooted my drinks over to the other end of the counter so I wasn't in his way in regards to checking out. I turned to him and apologized for taking up his space, and started fumbling with the cans, trying to figure out how to balance them + my phone + my wallet.\n\nI was about to ask the cashier if I could leave my purchases here, walk home, grab a bag, walk back, pick my stuff up and go back home. While that would be double the walking (about 20 minutes total), I felt it would be much easier; I didn't want to risk dropping a can and it exploding, especially because the cans were chilled and with the heat outside they'd get lots of condensation and become very slippery. But then...\n\nThe other customer said, \"well, hey, I have a bag I can give you.\" I looked at him in confusion, and he gestured to the reusable shopping bag he had brought with him (smart man!), and what he was purchasing: a bag of milk.\n\n(For those unfamiliar with the concept of bagged milk: it's a product in Canada. Here's some examples, from Google ([1](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVlQCjgqEAsaw8kgAF4QfdjyYVI=/0x0:2048x1536/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x1536):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19306437/milk_bag.jpg), [2](https://greenlivingtips.com/content_images/2008a/milk-bag.jpg)). Basically, there's a big plastic bag, and inside that bag is 3 smaller bags. In those bags is a little over a liter of milk, and you put that smaller bag into a pitcher/jug with a handle (specifically designed for this purpose), snip off the corner, and pour the milk into your glass).\n\nHe said, \"why don't I take out these bags, put them in my reusable bag, and you can take the plastic bag the smaller bags of milk come in?\" I asked him if he was sure, and he said, \"yeah! It's less plastic I need to get rid of later, then, anyhow.\" I told him I was very grateful, and asked if I could purchase his milk for him as a thank you. He said, \"absolutely not!\" I asked if he was sure, and he confirmed once more that he absolutely wouldn't accept that. I was going to insist, but I wanted to respect his decision because he seemed steadfast in it and I didn't want to make him feel weird. I thanked him profusely, and now I'm at home with my drinks.\n\nThank you, kind gentleman.

When you attempt to download the latest flash version, there will be a warning saying that the installer could not find the plugin directory to work with the browser. So I have been using Macromedia flash player 8 from oldversion.com which came bundled from Macromedia flash pro 8.

So that would turn out to be my last resort if all else failed. Anyway, I had time to spare so I thought, why not.

I know most people are skeptical of that kind of thing but my rule of thumb is I'd rather get scammed out of a $10-15 meal then let someone go without a meal if I have the means to help.  So yesterday I was driving home from work and I see the woman holding a sign saying she recently lost her job and anything would help.  A few feet away were her kids, ranging from around six to around 16.  I did my usual and picked up some fast food.  I spent a little more than usual because of the kids, around $30 total.  When I dropped it off, she gave me the biggest, happiest smile I have ever seen.  All I did was give her and her kids some chicken and soda but she was so grateful for just that.  I've never seen someone's eyes light up the way hers did when I handed her that food.  It really made me think how lucky I am.  I mean I complain about my parents like every teen does but these kids had been sitting in the sun for at least a couple hours and were just so appreciative for two meals to share.

I never was really friends with the other girls because they were always talking about boys and makeup and drama while I was always more focused on my grades, college, or reading (my choice, not my parents).  I didn't dislike any of them, just always felt out of the loop and disconnected.  I was homeschooled so my only interaction with other people my age was these eight or so girls who hung out all the time and never invited me.  Again, they weren't always trying to be mean (sometimes they were because...well it's teenage girls) but they were always closer with each other because they shared common interests.  I would try to not let it get to me, but it always hurt that everyone seemed to always have someone to talk to and I had nobody.  My mom always told me I would find my group eventually and it would just make the friendship that much more valuable.  Well, I finally found my group.  It's a strange friend group but I feel connected.  And on top of that, I actually have a best friend!  I started training a new sport last year and found I had a lot more in common with my training partners. Granted, most of them are a good ten to twenty years older than I am (I'm in hs so the age gap is obvious when we go out together) but we're all really close and talk a lot.  I also have someone to call my best friend!  I never would have imagined someone like her actually being friends with me.  She likes dressing up and going out, is extroverted, optimistic, a go with the flow kind of person, and isn't super competitive.  I, on the other hand, hate shopping/dressing up, view myself as a nerd (I think of it as a compliment so no, I do not have low self-esteem), am a little more negative, feel the need to plan everything down to the minute (<20 min early = late), and am super competitive to the point where I spend all my free time training.  She also is a very touchy-feely person, whereas I am not so much.  Recently, we became very close to the point where she will sometimes refuse to go places with the rest of the friend group if I'm not able to go because she feels closer to me than the others.  The other day, she mentioned that she got me something small for my birthday and I am so happy.  She actually remembered my birthday after I only mentioned it once and, as if just remembering it weren't enough, felt the need to get me something.  I cannot believe how lucky I am to have found someone who values me as a person and the friendship doesn't feel one sided!\n\nTL;DR:  I struggled to connect and make friends my whole life, I finally found my niche!", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

My first fear was they had been swallowed by the washing machine and were now in the sock afterlife. But more realistically, I thought they'd been stolen by my sister. \n\nWe both have similar light blue jeans, she got her pair first when she was at university, so I didn't know she had them when I bought a similar pair (my slip up, I'll admit). We've been dealing with having the same jeans that keep coming out of the wash for a couple of years.\n\nJust after Easter, my pair went missing. I mentioned to my sister if she'd accidentally taken my jeans from the wash, she said she hadn't, and showed me the pair that she had in her wardrobe. I have other pairs of jeans so I wasn't actively looking for it out of necessity, and I was stressed with my exams so didn't think about it so much. And now it's been a long time since I've thought about those jeans. Until I was collecting my laundry (I usually procrastinate it, so sis gets there first) and found a pair of light blue jeans and remembered my old jeans. So I took them into my sister's room (at this point they had been gone for so long that my sis must have had them) thinking I'll find them in her wardrobe. I was pretty sure the pair I was holding were her pair not mine, though. \n\nAnd there she was, sitting at her desk, wearing a pair of light blue jeans. \n\nWe both just laughed. And she said that she had been thinking the laundry was being washed and dried quite quickly (I guess she would put her jeans in and the next day take a pair from the wash, and the cycle continued). \n\nI am going to do some sort of embroidery on mine so this does not happen again. But I have my jeans back and I am happy \ud83d\ude00!\n\nTL;DR Jeans went missing a few months ago.

{"post": {"title": "TIAH because I got a 8.5 on my IELTS Academic Test on my first try.", "id": "p8y8ji", "created_utc": 1629576136.0, "selftext": "Personally, I've always loved the English Language, owing mostly, if not completely due to my love of reading and writing. \n\nI'm absolutely terrible at my native language and yet I can talk off an American's ear in English. I even got a distinction (getting highest marks in the country) in my IGCSE exams where I took English as a first language  instead of second like my classmates. I was also on a specialized track, so my exam was harder so that achievement was, and still is, my biggest achievement.\n\nNothing can top that.\n\nBut I've been struggling ever since. A close friend of mine passed away due to you know what, and my A level exams kept getting delayed which made my parents more and more anxious which in return placed even more pressure on me, since I'm taking 7 subjects in A levels.\n\nI'm an A* student, and I used to love studying but lately I've been down with everything. So since I'm applying abroad for university, I was required to send in an IELTS proficiency score and my dad signed me up for it. \n\nAs soon as I started studying for it, I immediately felt a change. I wasn't as pressured, tired or worried. IELTS wasn't a test  I needed to score high in unlike my A levels exams; I just needed a 6.5 out of 9 to get in all of my universities. And I already knew my English was good enough for that.\n\nThere was no pressure from my parents too, since they knew this wasn't a test related to my academics. So when I started studying, I felt really happy and excited. I realized how much I'd missed reading and writing stories, doing comprehension passages etc. It wasn't a hard test by any means even though I was doing the Academic practice tests which are notoriously harder than General ones.\n\nIt was like I was solving a fun quiz, with no pressure to do well. That was when I started challenging myself. I wanted to get an 8 no matter what. I was expecting my proficiency to be around 7 so I knew I had to work for it and that excited me, because I wasn't doing this for the grade, I wasn't doing it for my universities or my parents-- in those moments I was doing it for myself, because it was fun.\n\nAnd I loved every moment of it.\n\nI'd once been this type of student, the type to challenge herself so reverting back to that old, energetic personality of mine was amazing. I felt happier, livelier and more energized that I'd been in a long time. Even my mom comment how I'd been smiling more these past few days.\n\nI'd never realized how much I missed all of it.\n\nThen there came the test date, and I was literally quaking in my boots from nervousness. But it was in a feel good way, not the nausea inducing one when you know you have to do well or the world's ending. I knew I'd do well, but I wanted to better. \n\nThe test flew by in a blur and I was really happy with it. Writing and Listening were easy as always and I finished Reading a full thirty minutes early! Courtesy of SAT's very scary reading section. Speaking had worried me most, since I was worried about my accent but even that went well. \n\nLooking back there were things I overlooked due to my nervousness, since it was my first time giving IELTS and I wanted to do well in it. Those little mistakes tormented me throughout that 13 day wait, making me worry that that 8 was a far cry. But I wasn't too hung up over it, since I knew I'd done my best and I was satisfied with it. Haven't felt like that in long, long time.\n\nI'm the first in my family to give A levels but both my parents have taken the IELTS exam before so we finally had something to relate on and talk about, both of them giving me tips. So they knew best how good of a score I'd gotten and they were ecstatic. \n\nTo my surprise I got an 8.5 out of 9!\n\nI don't know, this is my first achievement after a long, long time. I've been down the dumps for so long, that doing well in something I love made me jump for joy. Like I was literally jumping around my room in happiness. It's not an A level grade of course, bit it's means something to me regardless.\n\nIt feels good-- it feels great actually to do well in my IELTS exam, especially on my first try. I finally feel like the me of two years ago-- energetic and revitalized. It's a small step in the right direction, in the big picture that is life but it means so much to me. I've been smiling like an idiot all day, prancing around my room as if I've won the lottery.\n\nI know my A level exams are coming up, I've got a butt load of  university applications to fill out and have a SAT exam before all that, but I'm happy nevertheless.\n\nThis small victory after a serious of stressful failures feels like a beacon of hope, that I can learn to love learning once more without the burden of achieving grades.  It's an amazing feeling, one that had me on my phone typing on Reddit because I want to share with someone, anyone. Thank you for listening to me!\n\nTLDR: I got a really good score in my IELTS test! I've been very sad for a long time so this small achievement made me feel like I could learn to be happy, and grow to love the things I used to once more!", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Yes, you read that right, $3000 for a sick horse that can never even be ridden because he suffers from a terminal illness in his hooves due to being neglected.\n\nAfter trying to negotiate on many occasions by different people, they decided to file a complaint of Animal Abuse to the police so that he can get punished and face some sort of consequence for the suffering he caused to this poor horse.\n\nFor some reason i don't understand, the complaint is taking ages.

{"post": {"title": "TIAH because my mum has a conflict with the neighbours about our trashbins", "id": "m76d8u", "created_utc": 1616003886.0, "selftext": "To understand the significance of this conflict, you need to know some things first. My parents got divorced 25 years ago, after which my mum moved to a new house. She used to have really nice neighbours (even after my dad moved away 15 years ago, they still describe us as the neighbour's kids). \n\nThe way the new house was set up meant that we had neighbours on the left and right, a street in front and two rows of gardens in the back. The house on the left had a very high turnover; it was empty for a while, then a lady lived there for a short while before moving in with her partner, then an alcoholic neighbour with two cats who was eventually evicted, then a lady with two young kids who eventually also moved in with her new partner, and eventually a young family. While we had a decent relationship with these people, the neighbour bit was usually short lived.\n\nOn the right was a family that already lived there when we moved in. This family consisted of a very average father (average height, average weight, he didn't wear very colourful clothes, was generally well kept and had a very average job as a mailman, just all around very normal and well average), a mother who was pretty much his opposite (poofy, blow dried hair painted reddish (similar to Princess [Beatrix](https://www.google.com/search?q=beatrix&client=firefox-b-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&biw=1920&bih=938) but tacky), new clothes pretty much every week which were loud and colourful (leopard print, pink and glittery) and lots of make up), two daughters (one eventually came out as FtM transgender) and a rabbit (which was not allowed to pee in the garden on Sunday, and got loudly scolded by mum if he dared do it anyway). Their daughter eventually married and got kids which came over all the time and cried and yelled and were very annoying. \n\nVery soon after we moved, this lady decided that she didn't like my mum. She did not allow her husband to talk to my mum and they ignored us pointedly if we met them in town (small town so it happened often). She even put a nasty note in our mailbox when my mum dared make a bit of noise one Saturday morning for a minute (this happened once, my mum is generally very quiet outside). It seemed like this lady's issue was that my mum was divorced and that's bad or something. Maybe she was afraid she would steal her husband or inspire him to divorce her? Idk. Her daughter actually got divorced too, but that was apparently ok. It was very annoying and tiring and just meh. We lived next to these people for over 20 years. \n\nOnto the actual story: two years ago, my mum bought her own home and moved away. The set up of the houses is the same, but both neighbours have lived here for 40 years or something. Where I live, everyone gets three containers of 120 or 180 L; one for paper, one for organic waste and one for whatever's left. Glass is supposed to be disposed somewhere else and we get free plastic bags to put plastic/metal/packing material in. The containers and the bags are picked up on a regular basis, and I installed an app on my mum's phone that tells her when to put the trash out. The trash is outside of our garden on a shared square, as are those of one of the neighbours.\n\nSomehow my mum has gotten in some sort of 'conflict' with the neighbour over who is putting the trash out. Before she got the app, she would see the others put out the trash or keep track of it herself, go out and then the neighbour already took our containers, but now she gets a notification as soon as she's allowed to put it on the street (after 17:00 the day before) and she will actually run outside to be able to take her container and the neighbours' and then send a victory text that she already took the trash out. \ud83d\ude02 If she is late, she will pay very close attention to when the truck arrives the next day, then run out and retrieve the empty containers. If she's away, she'll text me to make sure I put the trash out before the neighbour can do it. \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt's absolutely hilarious but I'm also very happy she finally found a nice place to live with friendly neighbours. :)\n\nTL;DR: Mum used to have shitty neighbours, then moved and now she races the neighbours for who can put both of their trash containers out for collection, then sends victory texts when she's beat the neighbour to it and was able to take theirs as well because they actually have a good relationship.", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

This is my first time posting and I know this is a small thing but I am beaming with joy and I wanted to share. Today was my first small victory against my Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

Even if I don't get in direct contact with a chemical and I just touch the container I get incredibly anxious, so I start to obsessively wash my hands to try and ensure nothing bad happens to me. And even after washing my hands I would still continue to be anxious for hours or days on end.\n\nI started therapy a few months back, and a part of OCD treatment is exposing yourself to your fears, so my therapist asked me to touch the bleach bottle every day and not wash my hands for at least an hour. This has been incredibly hard for me, it made me very anxious and after the hour had passed I would go and immediately wash my hands. But not today! Today I touched the bleach bottle, tried to distract myself with something and it worked!

I brought the pizza out to her and she told me thank you. I told her your welcome to enjoy your food. Then I just continued working and finishing the things up I needed to before my shift ended. Around 8:00 I started cleaning the grill at my workplace. I turned around to grab a rag and the woman I gave the pizza too was standing there.

As we were finishing the loading a gentlemen also loading his car finished and offered to put away the cart for us. And he did that with both of our carts while smiling and giving a thumbs up. Simple but it made the process a lot easier.

I of course took the baby up and he held me as hard as he could and rested his head on my shoulder.

I really hope he is the one and I have absolute confidence that he may be.\n\n\u2022 I'm two months sober from weed, excessive drinking, and acid! I do occasionally have a taste to explore my pallet in drinks for culinary reasons but I haven't gotten the slightest bit buzzed and I'm proud of myself that I don't feel the need to be intoxicated or high anymore.\n\n\u2022 I got a partial tuition grant to go to a local community college next year! The next steps are to either find a job and save up or get enough scholarship money. My goal is to major in childhood education and get my TEFL certification so that I can achieve my dream job of teaching around the world.\n\nMy entire life has never been or felt better and I owe it all to my boyfriend. I can't wait to start college and finally begin my life!\n\nTD;LR: My life is turning around for the better because of my boyfriend always having my back, I'm two months sober, and I got a tuition grant making my dreams of higher education possible!", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I was just so excited to write a post just to capture this happy feeling.\n\nIn the last 4 years, I've done really a lot of work internally to identify myself in the haze of the depression that was my time in high school. A lot of pieces fell perfectly in place so that I was shipped off to college without the slightest ability to care for myself, and thankfully, I was able to start that process on my own. The person I am today is so much more grounded and can even actually perceive a future beyond the next day for myself, and that alone would be enough for me to say TIAH.\n\nBut also, a lot of this didn't come from just myself. My friends, however poorly I've unfortunately treated some of them, have been such a force of positivity and validation where my family would not be. And for that, I love them a lot and am deeply grateful. We're all shades of LGBT as well, and that part of having a supportive social group also helped me grow into myself comfortably without an extended period of denial or other reason for self-hatred. We're emotionally rather close and pretty open with each other, and in that casual way of being a little too vulnerable sometimes online, I grew really attached to them.\n\nAs part of also identifying my own self-esteem, I've also worked on weaning off that dependence without even having to lose that core friend group, which is yet another plus. And yet, none of these things were even my original TIAH thought, because one of those friends and I have sat down and had a good, honest discussion about our feelings for each other. And we're not sure if it'd be anything serious yet, and we're not going to even tell the rest of our friends just yet, as it's only been a week since she first asked me and we're not even sure yet ourselves if it'll stay.\n\nWhat I'm so happy about is both my first hint of a relationship (especially a healthy one to start) and just that I'm in a place where I could participate in that dialogue with someone and feel us being a bit vulnerable and not beating myself up about it in a parallel background thought. I really trust that we could decide to just go back to being friends and that I'd still enjoy her company. All I want from this is to help her find happier times and to explore myself as well in this new dimension of self.\n\nAll of this, every bit of it, would have been unthinkable to the me of 5 or 6 years ago. I'm so unspeakably full-hearted to be standing where I am now. And I'm sure I'll have down days. I'm sure we'll run into troubles that don't feel so fluffy or warm. I'm sure things will get grim eventually for unrelated reasons too. But I've already made so much progress that I don't think I could lose even if I tried now, and I'm really emotional just thinking about it all.\n\nI just didn't really have anywhere to say all of this since we're keeping it on the down low from our friends for now, but it was also really appealing to just kind of yell into the Internet a little with excitement when I found this subreddit just now! I hope anyone who reads this has a good day or night or afternoon, even if it does have some shitty parts in between :>\n\nETA: Looks like this counts as long? tl;dr: I'm much healthier mentally than I used to be and I'm tentatively vaguely seeing someone but feel healthy mentally about it and hope the healthy mental habits persist.", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I got into a company of punks because of girl I liked, witness a lot of drug abuse (being exposed to drugs for the first time in my life) and a lot of crazy shit in general. The girl I liked (let's call her Tina) was manipulative and clearly using me but my past self ignored it to have his \"love story\".\n\nBut I wasn't the only one fooled, there also was a girl that we'll call Jane from now on, she was also really into Tina and was in relationship with her. We really got along even tho we had the same love intrest. I got attached to her, not romantically, she was like a sister to me. The problem was that Tina was also using Jane. She used her to get money for drugs and Jane was her alibi in case her mom got suspicious, she used me for the same things while draining me emotionally. The problem was that Tina was dragging Jane down the addiction path while Jane tried to get her out of it. At that time I was too stupid to realise that Jane was the real victim here.\n\nAnd how would you know, shit hit the fan, Jane also got addicted and girls got into argument and broke up. Ofc me being blindly in love with Tina made me take her side without thinking much and believing every little lie she told me. Few months went like that with Tina manipulating me to stay with her, breaking up with me when I started to get my common sense back, getting back together few months later only to realise she's still the same manipulative bitch and quickly backing out.\n\nA year passed since me cutting of any contact with punks and living my life normally. And then it hit me. Jane was the real victim, I took the wrong side and let that amazing person get sucked up by addiction and then cut contact with her. Guilt followed me for 3 months on and off and I finally decided to get in contact with Jane again.\n\nThis was the best decision I could make, turns out she didn't blame me for anything and we quickly catched up with how our lives went.\n\nIn short her life was still a mess, she was in abusive relationship and still battling addiction. I started to help her sort it out, I didn't really do much but I was always supportive and she said that I'm one of very few people she actually trusts. \n\nAnd now finally why I'm happy, she's finally getting her life back on track, dumped that abusive guy, found a dude that is supportive and helps her fight her demons (he is the guy who helped her the most, I can't take the credit for that) and she is on detox to stop taking drugs. And it makes me extremly happy that at least one thing from this whole mess ended up good. I reunited with a person close to me, helped her a bit in beating her problems and fixed a mistake from the past that was slowly killing me from inside. At last this rollercoaster had a good ending. And I'm typing this now since Jane nearly gave me a heart attack after sending me a photo of her having blood on her lips and nose out of nowhere and not explaining that it was because she got her lip pierced, before I freaked out that someone hurt her. And as I was looking at the photo of her new piercing (now without the blood) I had tears come to my eyes and I realised how happy I am that she's allright and I got back in touch with her. And I am ready to help and protect her anytime if she needs me.\n\nTl;dr\nI did nothing when my friend got addicted to drugs because of manipulative gf, after a year got back in contact with her and helped her get her life back on track and I'm really glad I haven't lost her.\n\nEdit: spelling is hard", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

After leaving both these things in the past and living for myself, I am happy \n\nGrowing up, I had immense pressure from both my mother and the church to be perfect, sinless, and pure. I had a purity ring, my mother never taught me sexual education, I was only allowed to listen to Christian music, watch TV rated G/PG, play video games that were rated E, etc etc. My mom checked my grades online EVERY day, and I was expected to maintain perfect grades, even in PE with a knee injury. My mom put bars on my window, didn\u2019t allow me to hang out at friend\u2019s houses if the parents didn\u2019t pass her interview (no alcohol at their house, no secular music/TV/views, no going anywhere unless approved by her). I felt ashamed of my human nature to \u201csin.\u201d Doing certain things like having sex, dating women (I\u2019m a woman), wanting to hang out with people, or even listening to music I wasn\u2019t supposed to would make me so anxious that I vomited and had diarrhea. My mom ALWAYS knew when I was doing something I shouldn\u2019t be doing because my anxiety symptoms were very obvious to spot, considering it made me seem like I had a stomach bug. She constantly told me God was watching me and that he knew what I was doing every moment of everyday. I felt like a failure in everything so I began isolating myself. I became more anxious and depressed and never left my room except for having family dinner and doing my chores. When I turned 18, I moved out even though I was still in high school. My depression and anxiety got worse before they got better because being an adult was hard. I learned how to navigate adulthood but lost my passion for adventure, reading, writing, and being artistic. Today at 23 years old, I am realizing just how far I have come. For two-ish years I have not experienced anxiety unless it came from my mother meddling because she is not very involved in my life. \n\nI have found freedom and passion again. I dress the way I want to, have piercings and tattoos that my mother disagrees with, and no longer believe the lies she tells me about my appearance (weight, tastes, and \u201cmutilation\u201d of my body) I go to the gym, do yoga, have gotten a state park pass, eat healthy, meal prep and cook for my loved ones (friends mostly). I participate in a book club, have started doing cross-stitching, and am starting to make friends in my new town. I have really amazing friends, a fantastic boyfriend, and very low contact with my mother. I no longer participate in religion, not because I don\u2019t want to believe, but I simply cannot deal with the guilt and anxiety that comes from participating. I have found a new motivation to pull myself out of my shell and in the process my depression, self doubt, self hatred, anxiety, and isolation have all faded away one by one. \n\nI wake up happy to go to work. I look forward to going to the gym. I love the old and new friendships I have made along the way. \n\nI love my life. I live for myself. I have had to cut contact with my mother in the process, but we still talk. We still visit, but it\u2019s on my terms now. She has no power over me, as it should be as an adult woman. I am powerful.

I didn\u2018t expect to make great progress since I still was tired and when I\u2018m tired I\u2018m having a very hard time in hearing all the stuff that is going on, but it worked really well and I even managed to fix the low frequencies. we didn\u2018t record a bass, since it is traditional Columbian music, and my colleague kept telling me that we would have to. luckily there are enough low frequencies going on in one of the drums, and I amplified them. worked out perfectly.\n\nTL;DR\nI work as stagehand and had a nightshift, that was rewarding, fulfilling and great fun, spent the day with speeling and cuddling with my bf, who took me to awesome running sushi later and I fixed some problems in a song I\u2018m mixing for a university project.", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

And I felt like I absolutely bombed the audition, which I still believe is true, I messed up the singing part really badly and I can't dance... or act, really, either... But nothing about callbacks were mentioned during the audition, so we just assumed that if we had one, we'd get a note or something.\n\nSo after a few days, I hadn't received any information about callbacks, I thought my fears had been confirmed. And for the first time at my high school, I was 100% sure I wouldn't get a decent part, unlike the previous years where I thought maybe I could possibly get a kinda-sorta-okay role...? But I had prepared myself for the worst, and was pretty sure I wasn't going to get a part.\n\nI found out that the cast list had been posted at the end of break today, so after science, on my way to lunch, I decided to check the cast list. As I was walking down the corridor, my friend, who had just been to look for herself, was screaming at me, \"You got a main role!! You got a main role!!\" And I shook my head, telling her that I knew she was joking. I genuinely didn't believe her.\n\nBut lo and behold, on the cast list next to my name was \"Billy\".\n\n''Okay,'' I thought. ''Probably a small character with a few lines. I'm happy with that.'' And I set off to the toilets to wash my hands in the toilets.\n\nNext to the toilets is the Music Studio, where my bf goes every Friday for Choir. He was stood outside, waiting for the teacher to come along and unlock the door. He came up to me and asked me what role I got. \"I got this character called Billy,\" I said. \"Apparently he's one of the nerds or something. I don't think it's a 'main' role, but it's an okay one.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool. Better than a chorus role, then.\" We conversed for a while before I left to wash my hands. When I got outside, I went to sit with my friends. I took out my phone to research my character, and close to the top of the cast list was his name. I was confused; Billy's not that good of a role, right? Wrong. I read the description, and began to realise that my role isn't as minuscule as I thought.\n\nSo basically, this made me happy. Especially since I haven't got a main/decent role since Year 5! And I also have to sing Never Gonna Give You Up, which is going to be a great opportunity to look back on and laugh at. I'm genuinely looking forward to this! :D\n\nTL;DR, I got a pretty good role in my school production of Back To The 80s, and I haven't got a main role for years.\n\nEDIT: Grammar n' stuff.

We\u2019ve fooled around a bit everyday so far, but had only had sex once leading up to this point. Well tonight, we had just gotten out of the shower when I started seductively teasing her. A bit of time passes and I start fingering her, it getting pretty hot and heavy the longer I go. It goes up until she just can\u2019t take it anymore. At this point we\u2019re both pretty turned on, so we decide to go all the way again. We\u2019re going at it you know, dirty talking and whatnot, when I tell her I\u2019m getting close. She looks at me and says she is too. Now, out of all the sexual pleasure I\u2019ve given to her, I\u2019ve NEVER (despite really trying) heard her say that before. We keep going until we both end up coming together. It was *fucking amazing!* When she told me she came, I can\u2019t even explain how excited I was. I\u2019ve been trying to satisfy her the way she does me for what seems like forever, and now I\u2019ve finally done it! I hope I\u2019m able to do so again in the future.", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Due to some issues in the past, I've always been afraid that if I let the people around me know too much of what I'm like, they wouldn't like me. I've always felt like I've had to work harder and be perfect to make up for whatever deep flaw I've been \"hiding\" in order to even be liked moderately. It's not an uncommon fear, but it has kept me from doing things I want to do.\n\nLast night, I went to a friend's apartment to watch some anime (yay for weeb Fridays). Due to some miscommunication, it was a while before his old roommate could get there to join us, so by the time we got underway I was pretty tired. We watched a couple episodes of a pretty long show we've been working through since the start of the school year while Old Roommate worked on his senior project. It was really nice--I felt comfortable reacting to whatever was happening onscreen instead of staying quiet like I usually do in larger groups. After it was over, Old Roommate pulled up a video of rainy-mood study music and started telling Friend how he had managed to listen through the whole 10-hour mix while working on different projects. \n\nWith some chill music playing and the sound of the rain from the video and some actual rain starting up outside, the usual tension left my body, and I began to relax. After a couple minutes, Old Roommate looked up and said, \"MLup1n looks like she's about to pass out.\"\n\nI could have told them all of that--that I just felt comfortable being around them because friendship and all that. I could have told them how much the time I spend with them means.\n\nBut getting sentimental at stupid-o'-clock in the morning seemed like something I would regret when I woke up the next day, so I just said, \"Yeah, I'm getting pretty tired. I should probably head back.\"\n\nAs I walked back to my apartment, I just felt really happy for people that I can feel comfortable being myself and relaxing around. It's probably my own perception, but I don't perceive a lot of social demand from them, and it's nice to be able to just watch things with them and not have to talk a lot. They're both graduating soon, so I'm definitely happy for the time we still have now.\n\nTL;DR: Not a people person, really like the people I really like, glad for good friends I can relax around.", "subreddit": "TodayIamHappy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I came back on Sunday around 4pm and R didn\u2019t come to the front door to greet me which was kind of weird but not completely bizarre, maybe he was in a real deep nap, right? My roommate, M, and I eventually sit down to chat and watch the rest of True Detective. R will ALWAYS come to the living room to watch shows with us. So as soon as I said to M, \u201cThat\u2019s weird, where\u2019s R?\u201d M\u2019s face just drained of color and he said, \u201cWhat do you mean? I thought you took him to your SO\u2019s Friday night?? He\u2019s not here?\u201d \n\nWe both proceed to panic and look everywhere in the apartment. I see that I left one of my windows open and some of the screen was broken so I immediately picture R jumping from our 4th floor to the ground below, dead, and I end up having the second panic attack I\u2019ve ever had in my life, the first one happening about 13 years ago. I scream, cry, curse, yell, call my landlord who is like a surrogate father at this point (I\u2019ve lived in this building for 6 years) who comes by to help with the search within 20 minutes. My SO also drives over. \n\nWe check the entire building, knocking on all the doors, basement all the way to the roof. Nothing. Neighbors tell us they saw him in the hallways around midnight Friday but no one ever knew he was mine or whose cat it was. At this point I\u2019m convinced he got let out into the world (I live in a major city) and I\u2019m going through literally all of the feelings. We talk to everyone on the street, walking down all of the blocks within the radius, into bodegas, I must have given 15+ people my number in the neighborhood. One girl on the street says she saw a cat that looked like mine over in her neighborhood, a 25 minute walk away. We drive over to that neighborhood and walk around, I\u2019m shrieking his name every minute or two. Nothing.\n\nWe go back to our neighborhood and we\u2019re told by another person that there\u2019s a lady who feeds street cats around 1am a block away. At this point it\u2019s about 11pm and I\u2019ve been losing my shit since 6pm. I saw a couple cats that looked like R, one I was so convinced it was him that I chased him over someone\u2019s fence and into their backyard which resulted in 2 people coming out of their homes scared as fuck. I apologized profusely and explained what was going on but yes, I was trespassing like hell and I would\u2019ve done it again. Waiting for 12:30am to go back out to see the cat lady a block away, I make a post on Craigslist and Pawboost and any other place I could think to spread the word. We go down the block and post up until about 1:30, no cat lady.\n\nWe eventually meet back up, me and M, at the front of our building at around 1:45. I say, Let\u2019s scour the building one more time before we pack it in and get some sleep so we can wake early and plaster the neighborhood with flyers tomorrow. We go down to the basement and the second time I called his name, I hear the sweet cries of my little boy. \n\nI can\u2019t even explain how I felt for those 7 hours. Panic, grief, annihilating rage, making all kinds of promises about how I\u2019m going to change my life, that he\u2019s the only thing that matters, how I\u2019m not scared about stupid shit anymore. \n\nYou know, the night my boy actually went missing was literally the first day that I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t smoke cigarettes anymore after 14 years. I went without smoking all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday until shit hit the fan. As you can imagine, I smoked my fucking face off.\n\nI was so scared and distracted by so many things in life before this happened. I\u2019ve had R since he was a kitten 6 years ago. I\u2019ve never lost him and never been without him. Nothing scares me anymore because when a part of you dies and then is brought back to life, man, anything literally anything is possible. I\u2019m done with cigarettes. I\u2019m not scared of commitment in my relationship now. I\u2019m ready to take it to the next level. I\u2019m ready to make the big move out of this state and into the one I\u2019ve been wanting for several years. I don\u2019t feel bad anymore about setting better boundaries in my work and I feel so much more driven to crush my goals and garner success in my business. \n\nI don\u2019t have children. R is my child and it\u2019s just so crazy that when faced with something like this, your focus on life seems to just clear, like fitting the right lens on a camera. I know what matters now and what doesn\u2019t. \n\nFor my little boy, well I took him to the vet on Monday and he got two shots updated. I\u2019m about to bring him again today for bloodwork (he was too anxious to do blood on Monday) and in about a week he will be getting a dental cleaning for the first time and when he\u2019s under for that, they will put in a microchip. \n\nI\u2019ve never been this relieved in my life.

{"post": {"title": "Why do you think he behaved this way?", "id": "1i31yq7", "created_utc": 1737068498.0, "selftext": "So I\u2019m looking for input on a situation I\u2019ve been trying to manage for the past few months, hoping to try and make sense of it.\n\nLast year, I moved to a new city for work. I\u2019m openly gay (with everyone, coworkers included). I\u2019m a writer, and since joining this company, I\u2019ve written a few blogs for the Pride employee group at work, where I shared some of my personal experiences.\n\nAfter the first blog was published in June for Pride Month, another guy around my age (late 20s) who lives in the city I transferred to (I lived elsewhere at the time) started calling me \u201cmy friend\u201d excessively. I only ever noticed him calling me that, and he also complemented me A LOT on that blog. I thought it seemed a little off, because while we had worked together remotely for a few months, we had never even met in person and hadn\u2019t really talked much about non-work things. I thought he was trying to be an ally or something and just moved forward without giving it too much thought at the time.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and I went on a trip to find an apartment in the city I moved to for work. A few days before the trip, he offered to help me look for apartments, which I thought was nice, but I didn\u2019t take him up on that because we still didn\u2019t really know each other well and a family member was helping me look already. We did exchange numbers though.\n\nA few weeks later, after I\u2019d found an apartment but hadn\u2019t moved to the new city yet, we had a one-on-one work call, and at the start of the call he told me, \u201cWhen you get up here, of course, we\u2019ll probably do something with the team, but I should take you out to dinner in [part of the city where I\u2019m living]. There are a lot of nice restaurants in [part of the city where I\u2019m living].\u201d I said yes, and although I had a sneaking suspicion that he\u2019d just asked me on a date, I also thought he could just be trying to be friends or be friendly, so I tried not to read into it too much.\n\nFast forward another month or so, and I moved up here. He had always seemed super friendly before I moved, but in person at work, he seemed totally different with me. He seemed shy, and I\u2019d notice him get nervous when I\u2019d talk with him. I also noticed him staring at me a few times, and he\u2019d even not break eye contact when I noticed. At this point I started to suspect he *may* be closeted or questioning, but I still didn\u2019t feel like I had enough info to know that for sure.\n\nHe was sick for a while, and then after that I invited him to go watch a soccer game (we\u2019re both soccer fans). He talked about inviting his brother to go too, which I agreed to. But then he never followed through, so I went by myself. I assumed that was a subtle attempt at communicating disinterest, and thought maybe he was just socially awkward or something.\n\nA few days later, I noticed him staring again, and being super shy around me at work. So I sent him a text to ask if he still wanted to grab dinner like he\u2019d asked a few months before. He said yes, and we made plans. A few days before, he asked if we could change to lunch instead because his brother and sister wanted him to go to dinner with them on the same day we had plans. I agreed, and then that Saturday we went to lunch. \n\nI got there first, and then when he got there, it was like he was a different person from how he was at work. He greeted me, and then told me, \u201cGive me a hug.\u201d I was surprised\u2014he didn\u2019t even shake my hand in the office when I moved, so I wasn\u2019t expecting him to want to hug. The conversation flowed nicely, although I felt a little awkward because now I felt almost certain that we were on a date. He was leaning in the whole time, and he maintained eye contact almost the entire time. When it was time for the check, he insisted on paying, and I let him. He asked about going out for dinner again soon, and I agreed. Then when we left, we chatted outside for a couple minutes, and then he told me, \u201cGive me a hug,\u201d again. We did and then parted ways.\n\nAt this point, I felt certain that was a first date. I texted the day after to say I had a good time and I offered to plan the dinner we talked about since he\u2019d done all the planning for the first one. He took a while to reply, but eventually did and agreed.\n\nA few weeks went by and we chatted. Things were friendly. Then it came time to schedule the dinner, so I sent him a text to arrange it. I found a fun looking activity we could do after dinner if he wanted and asked him about it. He took a while to reply again, and said that he still wanted to do dinner, but that he couldn\u2019t do the activity afterward because he was meeting with the woman he\u2019s been dating.\n\nI was crushed. He never mentioned dating anyone at the lunch (though he did talk a lot about an ex and a tough break up with her). I felt like I\u2019d been led on, and felt ill. I took a little time to decompress, and then replied back to let him know that based on all the behavior I\u2019ve described in this post I was under the impression that we had gone on a date and that this next one would be the second. I told him that maybe we should call off the dinner because I didn\u2019t want him to feel uncomfortable.\n\nHe replied back apologizing for the miscommunication, and he explained to me that he we were friends and that he wanted to be a good friend to me. He said that he wanted to hug me because I was his friend and he hugs his friends. He said he wasn\u2019t uncomfortable at all and that he appreciated my honesty and that he still wanted to get dinner as friends.\n\nI thought about it and decided to give him the benefit of the doubt, so I agreed and we went again as friends (or at least, I thought so). He got there a few minutes late and so I was already seated at the table. We had a seemingly normal conversation over dinner and then at the end I paid since he paid the time before. Oddly though, he let me know that the plans with the woman he said had been changed and that he\u2019d instead be spending time with his mom after dinner. I wasn\u2019t quite sure why he told me that, but I rolled with it. When it was time to leave, we walked out and he went for another hug before we parted ways.\n\nAt this point, I thought we were friends, but the inconsistent behavior over the past few months was really wearing on me at the same time. I felt very confused about a lot of the stuff I\u2019ve described here, and also concerned for him based on some of the stuff he told me about at dinner\u2014mainly that he wished he had more autonomy from his family. I sent him a text to invite him to join me on a hike I was going on the following weekend. He replied really quickly that he appreciated me thinking about him, but that he was super busy that weekend. He offered an alternative weekend and said we should invite another coworker.\n\nAt this point I was a little confused because that felt third wheely and sudden. I told him that I\u2019d really like to clear the air with him before I commit to that, because I was confused and concerned about him based on the things I\u2019ve pointed out in this post. At the same time, I told him that I totally understand if he doesn\u2019t want to talk, but that I was trying to be open and honest with my feelings (since he\u2019d just told me open and honest communication is really important to him the week before).\n\nHe replied like a totally different person.\n\nHe told me he was uncomfortable with the direction this was going. He said he knows that I expressed romantic interest in him, and that he didn\u2019t reciprocate and that he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the direction this was going. \n\nThat was completely untrue, and I was shocked because in my mind we\u2019d just agreed that we were friends the week before, and that I was just trying to be a good friend like he said he wanted to be. I replied back to apologize for making him feel uncomfortable and reiterate that I saw him as a friend and that I was confused since we just cleared that up the week before. \n\nHe replied that he wanted to keep things focused on work moving forward, and I replied that I would respect his wishes and boundaries.\n\nI wish that was the end of this, but things only got worse from there. I wrote another personal blog for a different employee group that he was a reviewer for. When I emailed the draft to him and the other person who publishes these, he sent me an individual message leaving the other person off it to tell me how brave I am. In the first paragraph of the draft, I talked about how I don\u2019t like being called brave, so I was a little upset that he did that, but tried to assume positive intent. I sent him a message to see if that was his way of trying to reconnect and I let him know I was willing to talk things out if he was. He didn\u2019t reply, so I moved forward.\n\nFast forward about a month later to December, and things started to get very weird. I started to notice he\u2019d pass by me at the place I run almost every time I was there (we\u2019re both runners). I\u2019d notice him in my peripheral vision but tried to not interact with him out of respect for what he asked of me. He started to stare at me as we\u2019d pass each other and even waved once. I waved back to be polite.\n\nThen at work one day, it seemed like he was physically following me a few times. The whole department was having a holiday celebration, and I excused myself from the room to go to the restroom. He was seated facing the only exit door, so he could clearly see that I\u2019d left the room alone. I was using the urinal in the restroom, and about 30 seconds after I got there, he was standing beside me at the urinal to my right. I thought that was creepy, but tried to write it off as a coincidence. Then after the holiday celebration, I was walking back to the area where we sit, in a different building, with a girl who works in our department. He walked behind us the whole way, just a few steps back. And then when I left the building for the day, he was right there behind me again. If any one of those things had happened, I would have written it off as coincidence. But given it happened three times all in the same day, I felt uneasy.\n\nI thought about it over the weekend a lot, and decided to try again to assume positive intent\u2014I thought maybe he was trying to reconnect and was trying to work up the nerve to have a conversation. So I sent him a text to tell him I\u2019ve reflected a lot and that I\u2019m willing to have a conversation if he is.\n\nHe reported me to HR, claiming that he couldn\u2019t get me to leave him alone. This was a blatant lie. I met with the HR representative, who was very kind and wanted to hear my side of the story. I explained everything I\u2019ve written out here, and explained to her that this whole situation has made me feel extremely uncomfortable, but that I didn\u2019t want to out him just in case he was in fact in the closet and just terrified, causing him to behave this way. She promised confidentiality, and said she would communicate to him that I am willing and want to keep things professional, and that he needs to do the same with me.\n\nI also let my manager know about the situation, and then had another follow up with the HR representative where she confirmed that he agreed to keep things professional as well. Since then, things seem okay, but I can feel his anger toward me radiating off of him when I\u2019m at work. I find this confusing as well, as I\u2019m not sure why he\u2019d be angry when I\u2019m doing exactly what he asked me to do. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019ve decided to move back to the city I came from and work from there again, in part to be closer to family and friends, and in part to put distance between myself and him. This whole situation has been very confusing and it has taken a toll on my own mental health. I really wanted to be a good and supportive friend to him because we got along well at first and he seemed like he really wanted to be friends (or more, looking at the context clues) with me, and it seemed like he was trying to confide in me about things he doesn\u2019t normally open up about. Ultimately, I feel really bad for him still and wish him well, but I\u2019m still shaken by the experience.\n\nI\u2019m pretty new to dating (I came out fully in my mid 20s, just a few years ago), and I also haven\u2019t experienced anything like this before. Anyone been through something like this before or have any thoughts about this situation? Not sure what I could have done better myself, but would love feedback to help myself show up better for people in the future too if anyone has any thoughts.

My parents and I were always very clear with coaches that skating was a hobby for me; I never intended to do anything more than have fun with the sport. I was working on getting my axel consistent and starting my first doubles when I quit. I stopped because skating was no longer fun for me when I was being constantly pressured by coaches to give up other interests (academics, cheerleading, sleepaway camp) in the interest of skating more, and verbally/physically abused when my parents and I did not agree (pre-safesport, ~15 years ago). \n\nAfter I quit, I didn\u2019t step on the ice for ~15 years. I thought I hated skating and everything to do with it. Recently, however, my friend convinced me to skate with her on a holiday rink, and I had so much fun. I have struggled to consistently exercise since recovering from a raging eating disorder in college, and I\u2019ve been skating almost every day for the last 2 weeks. I decide to look into coaching at my local park district rink (i.e.: not competitive at all) because while I don\u2019t ever intend to compete or test again, there\u2019s a few things (spins, backwards three turns) that I\u2019m struggling to pick back up through muscle memory alone because I\u2019m older, taller, and heavier than I was when I quit. I was very clear that I\u2019m looking for a few one-off lessons to figure out my center of gravity in an adult body so I can do skills I want to do on my own for fun/fitness, not consistent, weekly coaching or something to prepare for a test or competition.\n\nI was matched with a coach who agreed to everything I described above, and we had our first lesson this morning. She had me start by skating through all the basic levels, which I was fine with because practicing basics are important. However, when we reached basic 3, she got upset with me for doing \u201ccrosscuts\u201d instead of \u201ccrossovers\u201d. I tried to switch back to crossovers (which I had not practiced at all since returning to the ice, honestly I forgot they existed), but struggled to keep my alignment with my arms, not look at my feet, and not fall back into my muscle memory of crosscuts. With about 5 minutes left in our lesson, I asked if we could move on because I was getting tired and frustrated with either getting the feet right and the arms wrong or getting the arms right and getting yelled at for crosscuts. I fully intended to practice on my own and fix everything for the next lesson. She would not let me move on, and it brought back bad memories of repeating a skill over and over again with tears streaming down my face as a child, my coach getting angrier and angrier, even smacking me, but still not letting me take a break. I ended the lesson at that point, and the coach said she did not think we are the right fit for each other, which I agree with.\n\nBefore that incident, she did actually give me good feedback that I have strong, powerful edges and it\u2019s my messy upper body that is getting in my way. That piece of feedback actually allowed me to finally get a centered spin after I ended the lesson since I just focused on my arms and let my muscle memory carry the rest. After the session ended, I found the coach and apologized, explaining that old emotions that were not meant for her came up when she would not let me stop practicing a skill, she said she understood and hopes I find someone who is a better fit for me.\n\nMy question for you all is: is it reasonable to skate as an adult for purely fun and fitness, and still be able to retain my \u201cadult\u201d autonomy over lessons, like stopping when I\u2019m tired/frustrated/no longer having fun or working on basics for some of the lesson and more \u201cfun\u201d things for some of the time? Or, should I adjust my expectations and either learn to deal with the coaching I\u2019m given or opt to stay coach-less? I don\u2019t want to be rude and waste someone\u2019s time, and I also do not want to recreate the bad experiences that kept me away from the sport for so long.

Everyone has been really great and we all get along except for one person, who we\u2019ll call Jake. \n\nJake and I got along pretty well in the beginning, I think we had a similar play style when we first started, but he\u2019s slowly devolved into a stubborn, borderline misogynistic asshole. He\u2019s a political science major and our campaign is almost completely empire building and politics, which gives him the high ground over a majority of the players (myself included). He obviously knows a lot more than us about real world politics but has caused numerous problems in-game for us because of his lack of communication and inability to listen to others. \n\nI didn\u2019t really care about these things since everyone seemed to be having fun, but recently another player, who we\u2019ll call Louis, approached me and discussed how uncomfortable he had gotten with Jake\u2019s behavior. Louis is autistic and with the way he described it, it seemed like Jake had been continuously passive aggressive and even started ignoring Louis\u2019 opinion completely. The second Louis pointed it out to me, I started seeing all of the things he mentioned. Jake shuts down players extremely often, goes to huge lengths to prove his point, and has been causing problems with our DM because of how he believes the game should be run. \n\nThe more I interact with him, the more Jake makes me uncomfortable. I\u2019m the only girl in the group and Jake seems to make a point of telling me how \u201cemotional\u201d I get, which just feels wrong, and I can feel myself becoming more and more angry with him. I genuinely enjoy this campaign and it would suck to leave, but I\u2019m not sure how much more of this Louis and I can take. So, would I be the asshole if I left the campaign because of him? \n", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Things have been fantastic other than the sex life is a little lacking. I\u2019ve only made her cum twice and squirt once, going weeks between orgasms and only after 20-30 minutes with my tongue a certain way. She\u2019s never orgasmed by penetration with anyone. My dick is also slightly bent downwards when hard and she says this sometimes hurts her, especially from behind.\n\nOne night she was mentioning how I don\u2019t really satisfy her in bed (sometimes I do sometimes I don\u2019t) and she feels like she\u2019s missing out on sexual experiences. She\u2019s had about 12 partners so far and identifies as pansexual.\n\nI have yet to see her cheat on me since becoming official, although she did sext a little during the talking phase. She shares with me when guys message her most of the time.\n\nDuring our conversation I said I wasn\u2019t sure if I could handle an open relationship but I understand if she\u2019s not satisfied and the age gap also comes into play here.. I know I lost my virginity at 19 and certainly wasn\u2019t ready to settle down. She\u2019s been a great girlfriend.. cooks for me, takes care of me, I pay the bills and she doesn\u2019t work or go to school, but she makes up for it in other ways around the house.\n\nI asked her the other day if she\u2019d actually fuck anyone else and she said probably not. I check her messages and guys are always in her DMs but she ignores them or hasn\u2019t sexted or tried to make plans with them since we became official. We\u2019re together 24/7 and she shares her location with me so I know she\u2019s not cheating. She knows she doesn\u2019t have to cheat and can just be honest if she wants to fuck someone else.\n\nI admit I\u2019d rather her not fuck with other guys but part of me is thrilled at the idea of seeing her getting fucked or hearing about it. I\u2019ve seen videos of her with other guys (after turning 18 of course) and it got me off. I told her if she brings guys over she has to tell me first and she can\u2019t fuck guys outside our house or go on dates. Strictly sex. She agreed to this if it ever does happen. She\u2019s had a threesome before and is open to having another one. I\u2019ve never done this but the idea intrigues me.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t want an open relationship, I get it. With the age gap we\u2019re at two different stages of life. I\u2019d rather her be upfront and know she can explore rather than deceive me. But I am curious what will happen to our relationship if she does fuck other men. \n\nAt 34 and after years of monogamous relationships failing due to cheating, I\u2019m willing to try something else. Just curious to hear other experiences or advice for this situation. It sounds like it could be fun or heartbreaking, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll know til we try.

SGI leaders and members speak of \"[the Gohonzon](https://archive.ph/Lx2m0#selection-1607.0-1617.6)\" as if it's [a living entity](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/vt68sl/what_to_do_with_gohonzon/if6tbav/) or [a god](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1e41b7j/critical_thinking_is_everything/ldcocfr/); SGI parents have been told that, in the event of a house fire, they must make sure to save the Gohonzon FIRST and only after it is safe should they think to go back inside for important papers and valuables - and oh, yeah, [their CHILDREN](https://archive.ph/ZeEqG#selection-4067.3248-4067.3820), too.\n\n>The \"model\" of Gohonzon adopted by the Soka Gakkai corresponds to a version painted [inscribed] in the 18th century by Nichikan. It was not a choice: the Soka fortuitously came into possession of the clich\u00e9 [original, exemplar] of this Gohonzon after the split with Shoshu, thanks to a compliant (or perhaps business-minded) monk. \n\nI read somewhere that this \"business-minded monk\", a priest who betrayed his temple, sold the scroll to the Ikeda cult for a million dollars. Speaking of which, all those Nichiren Shoshu priests who defected in support of Ikeda's Soka Gakkai (and the generous bribes Ikeda's Soka Gakkai was offering) have now all disappeared. In the early 1990s, observers were noting that they could form a \"clerical class\" and Soka Gakkai could become a REAL religion on its own. Some of these \"domei\" priests apparently returned to Nichiren Shoshu; I have no idea what happened to the rest, but [Ikeda started developing a sour attitude toward them](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/lxduso/whatever_happened_to_the_domei_priests_the/) (they represented an ongoing commitment for financial support, after all, *and* they had their own *authority* due to their schooling and career within the religion, and Ikeda never liked to share authority) and now there are *NO* priests at all associated with Soka Gakkai.\n\n>>The Taisekiji gohonzon was replaced only in 1993 with a new set of scrolls received from T\u014dky\u014d\u2019s J\u014denji, while the vacuum in liturgical duties was filled by a group of dissenting Sh\u014dsh\u016b priests (\u201cThe association of Youthful Priests\u201d), who dissociated from the main branch after the excommunication, and helped in creating the \u201cLiturgical Division\u201d with a new asset of rites, including funerals (y\u016bjins\u014d, \u201cfriend funerals\u201d).

Not only are you skipping your turn in combat, but during the enemies and other players turns, you can't think or strategize either. Normally you could be thinking \"okay if the barbarian does this, I could do that, or maybe I can go help wizard...\". But when the only thing you can do is \"I roll my save and skip turn\" you aren't encouraged to think or pay very close attention. This isn't the most interesting or engaging way to participate in combat.\n\nIntroducing the homebrew rule I have been thinking about: \"down but not out\"\n\nWhen a player hits 0 hp, they enter a \"down but not out\" state. On their turn, down but not out players can use their movement to crawl 5 feet. Additionally, they can use their action to perform an \"I didn't hear no bell\" action.\n\nUsing \"I didn't hear no bell\" you can do one of the following: \n\n-move up to half your movement, after which you immediately drop prone again\n\n-make one weapon attack\n\n-interact with one object\n\nThings you explicitly can NOT do with no bell (you can't focus well enough for these, also anti cheese)\n\n-cast spells\n\n-access inventory\n\nNow as any doctor worth his license will tell you, moving about as you are bleeding profusely is generally considered a VERY BAD idea. Therefore using a \"I didn't hear no bell\" action immediately gives you a failed death save that only resets on a long rest (you are after all pushing your grievously wounded body badly and worsening your wounds).\n\nAt the end of your turn, you then still make a normal death save as you would RAW.\n\nI feel like giving this option makes going down more interactive. Because even if you decide to not do anything (or only move the 5ft) you can still consider it, weigh your options and in the end it becomes the players choice whether to take the risk or not. \n\nSo would you consider this a good/fun/engaging rule?\n\nWhat would you change about it?\n\nAny feedback is welcome.", "subreddit": "DMAcademy"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

We moved in together about a year ago after she finished university. I used to think she was the nicest person ever until a few months into us living together, I caught her talking about me in a really cruel way to one of my other \"best\" friends in our friend group. Since then I've noticed many qualities about her that made me realize she just plainly isn't that great of a human being, however due to many intricacies in our friend group that I won't bore you with, I can't just not be friends with her. \n\nIn short, she thrives on talking badly about others, making fun of them, and judging people. Especially people within our own friend group. She's the type of person to ask you \"how are you?\" just to get the \"tea\" on your life and then tell all of her friends about it as if it's some reality TV show. She's also very fake but in such a subtle way that I only notice because I live with her. For example, she will constantly pretend that she is a \"chill\" girl when it comes to guys and she pretends like she doesn't like guys even though everything she ever does it to get a boy's attention. She will swoon over a guy for years and then when he asks her to a date she will say \"I don't even know if I like him or want a relationship\" even though she would die to be in a relationship right now. She will also talk smack about someone for hours and then invite them over the next weekend. Additionally, she loves to \"play dumb\" about things like politics, money, work, you name it, just to get attention and be that \"bubbly girl\" who needs everything explained to her. \n\nShe is a very stereotypically pretty, blonde, skinny girl, was the popular girl in high school, makes friends very easily, and all of the boys legitimately fall in love with her and want to date her immediately. She is the type that breaks hearts and has multiple actually viable relationship options at all times. When guys like her, they genuinely want to marry her not just hook up. Last week she said \"I can't believe that guy didn't like me, that's the first time I've ever experienced that\". \n\nMe on the other hand, I am a very non-stereotypical pretty girl, with curly brown hair and I'm not \"skinny\" as in I have hips and a butt, etc. to the point I struggle to find pants that fit and the basic outfits don't always look good on me even though I want them to. I am pretty confident (at least on the outside), I'm successful in my career and have always been know to be \"smart\" and \"opinionated\". Some have called me intimidating before and it's always purely because of the mix between my beauty and education. \n\nThe reason I am most jealous is because everything always comes to easy to her, without her even really trying. Especially in the area of relationships. Without trying, she is loved by everyone, boys absolutely would do anything for this girl. Recently she got asked on a date by the guy she has talked about for years and she is out here pretending like she's not even excited even though I know she is. When she does that it literally makes me boil up inside. \n\nI acknowledge that I am so lucky and proud to be who I am and where I am in life, but at the same time, all I  have ever wanted is to be in love with someone who loves me. But instead I get stuck with a bunch of men who \"aren't ready\" for a relationship or just want to hook up. Meanwhile, these men treat her like a queen and she doesn't even need to try to be skinny or say anything smart or say anything funny or not be too opinionated. It especially kills me because she isn't a very nice person on the inside but that doesn't seem to matter to anyone who meets her. It makes me feel like she doesn't deserve the good things that come to her.\n\nI don't want to keep feeling like this inside, it genuinely kills me but I don't know how to change my thoughts about her especially after knowing that she isn't even a good friend to me and talks behind my back. I absolutely hate pretending like I'm happy for her and this new guy or anything good that happens to her. I know it doesn't make me a good person either and I just want to stop but i don't know how!!! It's driving me crazy inside, I have never felt like that towards anyone. \n\nPlease please be nice I already feel terrible about this. ", "subreddit": "selfimprovement"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Trying to hit these insane times (measured to a THOUSANDTH OF A SECOND) with whatever terrible car/track combination they throw at you is hilarious.\n\nAnd the thing is, it's not even fun. It's pure stress, even when you are getting golds relatively easy, because you're wondering \"oh man, when's the bullshit one going to pop up\" You're just doing the same thing. Over and over and OVER again. \n\nThe lack of available strategy is also just infuriating. Initially, yes you'll be messing around with braking zones and how you approach corners and tweaking the traction control, but then you run of of ways to improve and at that point it becomes absolute, pure luck if your brain neurons fire off the right combination of button presses at the precise times. When you plateau in times and stop improving in these license tests, only for you to still be several thousandths of a second off gold time is genuinely probably one of the worst feelings in gaming ever.\n\nAnd it's like you can't even stop. You can't retire for the night or whatever because you lose your muscle memory and you're going to have to spend another 30 mins when you come back just to get to the point where you're getting close to your old times again. And the fact your best ghost playback is just deleted if you back out of license is so stupid it makes me wonder if it's a programming mistake. Taking anything more than a short break is a surefire way to lose what little experience you built up trying the license.  \n\nAnd even after all of that, I hear the license tests are so much easier with wheel players. Any time there's going to be a stupid hard license test, it's ALWAYS the gamepad players that always get fucked over. Which is stupid because gamepad makes up probably 95% of the playerbase. You'd think they'd make sure it's reasonably doable on gamepad, but I guess not.\n\nI'm not saying these tests need to be brain-dead easy, but these times are just way too much to reasonably tolerate. I have hundreds of hours in this game and the fact even I, with my slightly-above-average skill level can't do these later licenses in at least a dozen or so tries is frankly ridiculous.", "subreddit": "granturismo"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Recently a guy kissed me and it didn\u2019t fell nice at all tho, he was tall and good looking but idk it just wasn\u2019t right. it was at a party the first time i met him so that might be why but i don\u2019t know i thought i wanted to do that but when it happend i just couldn\u2019t continue. also kissed with my girlbestfriend  while drunk before but haven\u2019t felt anything, simmilar to the guy at the club. don\u2019t know if it\u2019s important but i want to give full context bc i am really confused is all those stuff normal. \nI never had a boyfriend or anything like that.\nbut yea coming back to the subject lately i watch those accounts a lot, like a lot a lot and i don\u2019t think i get any sexual feelings for it but idk. also a lot of people assume i am gay when they met me which kinda messes with my head. a lot of those aligations come from the fact that i love combat sports, like i used to compete at a national level in rugby and jujitsu before my injury. i still fight a lot but more for fun. \nyea but coming back to the subject i never looked at girls this way before, i feel like i want a boyfriend and couldn\u2019t see myself with a girl but all the comments about people thinking i give gay vibes are getting to me.  I definitely had crushed on guys before, and maybe like two girls? but i am not certain if what i felt was romantic. \nidk guys i feel like i am missing out on teen romance, i really want a boyfriend but maybe i am bad at it bc idk i am just looking in the wrong spot. i used train for hours a day and at my gym there were mainly guys so i grew up having mostly guy friends. i am like really good at befriending guys bc of that but can\u2019t get a romantic vibe with a guy. also idk how to approach guys romanticly since i am so used to being really close with them physically (bc of bjj, people traing know what i mean) and otherwise but that\u2019s a whole another issue. it just feels forced when i do it so maybe i am like really in denial or something. \ndo any of you lesbians maybe see younger versions yourself in this description?\nalso sorry if i made anyone upset with this message or messed up some terms or said something bad i didn\u2019t mean to, it\u2019s just all those stuff are very new to me i dont really have any queer friends in real life so i really don\u2019t have anyone to ask. i am also christian so it\u2019s a hard subject for me but i wanted to get some opinions. thanks for your help!\n\n\nTLDR; Lately i have been watching lots of context sexualizing girls bodies and i am wondering if i might be not straight or is it normal\n\n\nsorry its so long i just wanted to put all the context so you guys fully get the situation and hopefully help me our \nso what are we thinking does this sounds like a lesbian deep in denial or just normal teen things??

I don't wanna fully commit to this opinion because my hype could be speaking for myself here, but this just might be the best car handling I've experienced on any sim ever. \n\nRWD cars behave amazingly well. You can go sideways with any car and it feels right, feels good. You can feel and hear the tires working under breaking with your car weaving a little. You can catch your car mid corner and it's not awkward. You ALWAYS feel the tires. FWD cars are also so much fun thanks to this. I was never a big fan of them in most of the sims, but they work, oh they work alright. Each car has its character and it's noticeable. I need some drift cars to try out. \n\nThere are negatives. AI is unpolished, UI non-existent with all the ACC placeholders and, well, gameplay features are not here yet. However all these things are something that can and most likely will be improved or fixed once the game gets some updates. \n\nI am really, really hopeful.

In this fight 2 of the 4 pillars(?) will come down at a time with Eggman in one of them. After they go back up the thing on top of the wall shoots out 4 energy balls(?) that Sonic has to get between without touching them. After you beat him you chase after Eggman for 3 seconds and hit him one last time.\n\nMusic: 3/5 I don\u2019t think I need to say this as I\u2019m sure it\u2019s heavily agreed on but it\u2019s hard for Sonic to have a bad song. And honestly the Final Zone theme isn\u2019t that bad. (Way better than the normal boss theme)\n\nDifficulty: 4/5 The only thing that really makes this hard is that there\u2019s no rings. But you can get caught off guard and get crushed or mess up your jump and have the energy ball things hit you. (The score on this doesn\u2019t determine how hard the fight is, it determines how good the difficulty makes the fight. Whether a fights too hard or too easy it could get a 1 either way)\n\nBoss Concept: 1/5 Probably going to be the only 1/5 on the whole list for concept because just look at this thing. All the bosses in Sonic 1 aren\u2019t much to talk about. BUT given that it\u2019s the first of the franchise does give it an excuse. But I\u2019m still giving it a 1.\n\nFun: 2/5 I mean idk, pretty sure the first games main purpose was about going fast. Not to say that the boss ruins the experience or just outright isn\u2019t fun at all, I just don\u2019t think that this fight has much going for it regarding how fun it is. Plus, who\u2019s going to think \u201coh I just can\u2019t WAIT to fight the Egg Crusher again!\u201d\n\nOverall: 5.2 For the first final boss of the series I would say it\u2019s good at best, but it pales in comparison to just about all the others. I do however think it was a good idea to hold off from super sonic. Then again it\u2019s entirely possible that they didn\u2019t think of super sonic until Sonic 2, and I don\u2019t remember if super saiyan first happened before or after Sonic 1, but either way it\u2019s a good start.\n\nNext: Sonic 2 (obviously)", "subreddit": "SonicTheHedgehog"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

First thing I noticed was a geocaching.com map which showed caches in the town. Nearly all the new ones were mine.

The committee made no attempt to contact me to express their concerns regarding my geocaches. \n\nSince February, I have placed over 30 more geocaches on town conservation land under the assumption that if the town had any issues, they would contact me.\n\nThe committee approved on a new Geocaching policy last month. Once again, I was not informed. Under the new guidelines, well over half my geocaches, including many I placed after February, are no longer compliant and must be removed. I can apply to place new geocaches but there are lots of new restrictions and caches can now only be placed under direct supervision of two members of the committee. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t sound fun at all so I doubt I won\u2019t even bother. \n\nGeocaching was basically dead in my town but after a year plus of hiding, I had geocachers coming to my town from all over the region because of the number and variety of geocaches they could search for. \n\nI feel like all my time and effort has been a waste.

Happy I'm back on days and feel much better, god bless night shift dispatchers someone's gotta do it.\n\nA reason I took the job was because I wanted the freshness of it, something new happening everyday. Lesson learned, no job will always feel like that, sometimes you get days where all you get is lift assists and false alarm line calls. Ofcourse it's not always like that, I still get calls i've never taken before every week even after almost a year of working here. You'll still get bored and sometimes you'll be agitated that you have to go to work tomorrow just like every other job. \n\nThis may be specific to my building, but it really does feel like i'm in a dark prison cell (we turn the lights of and have colored leds at each station), it has to be like that because it's florida and we get a lot of hurricanes, but some natural light would be awesome! It's a 5 minute walk to go outside and see some real light. \n\nI'm having trouble thinking of anything else, people are annoying sometimes and some calls suck to hear but that's the stuff we all know and honestly it's what bothers me the least. I've actually yet to get a call that sticks with me, maybe i'm lucky or maybe it's a me thing.\n\nHere's a list of what I do like, because I promise I don't hate my job and I don't regret accepting the offer:\n\nThe training was fun and interesting\n\nThe people here are friendly and offer useful advice and constructive criticism. (This doesn't happen at retail/food jobs) \n\nAmazing benefits atleast compared to AMC Theatres \n\nI get to go to work knowing that I'm a net positive for society for it. \n\nI feel like I'm compensated decently fair for the work I do, obviously more would be nice and I can't live without a roommate but it's more than the other jobs i've had. \n\nEven if 12 hour shifts are hard it's honestly pretty sweet when you consider how many days you have off. I only work 15 days a month and make more than both my parents. \n\nOh yea and three months of training fully paid. \n\nIn conclusion, it's cool and you should do it even if it doesn't end up being a forever job. Just be smart and be ready to have some discipline. ", "subreddit": "911dispatchers"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

We drifted a part slowly after high school but always kept in touch with this group of 4 girls various times throughout the year (D, T & E).\n\nEarlier last year, E got married and all of us were chosen as bridesmaids. I was living abroad at the time and flew home for the month to celebrate, and during this month spent probably the most time I had with these women than I had within the past 10 years post high school. During the bridal shower and wedding, I noticed lots of poor behaviour from D and T during the events - lot's of gossiping and making fun of people's appearances, just overall mean girl behaviour. (E.g. saying that a person we went to school with had to be domestically ab*sing her husband, because why else would he still be with her?) I called them out various times throughout the month, and they would laugh it off and apologise. I thought everything was all fine and I continue my 5 final months of living abroad.\n\nDuring this time, D gets engaged and both E and T get asked to be bridesmaids. \n\nOctober rolls around and it's E's birthday, and our tradition had always been to chip in to buy each other a decent birthday present. However this year, E sends a group message saying \"thank you for the flowers\", and I had not been included in the gift.\n\nMy birthday rolls around and I receive a small gift, when usually we would purchase each other a $150 present.\n\nHere's where it gets tricky. I am a makeup artist and had agreed to do D's bridal party makeup for her wedding. Because she was a friend of 17+ years, I didn't send her a contract (my mistake I know). She added and changed the booking multiple times, and I was extremely accomodating, once again because she was a close friend. On New Year's Eve, I received a text from her saying she had hired an additional makeup artist and is taking a client away from me - which would have been totally okay but it was never discussed with me. I felt like my business and my time wasn't being taken seriously, and I called her out for it. She apologised and I thought all was fine.\n\nFast forward to now - I catch up with E who has informed me I am not invited to D's bachelorette party. \n\nAIO for not attending the wedding in March? My current plan is to drop out attending and let her decide if she is comfortable having me as a makeup artist (I would lose a large amount of work, but honestly deep down I would rather pull out completely) \n\nI'm so hurt by the whole situation, I've known D since I was 10 years old and our families are close - I know people drift apart but I would never expect this to have happened. I don't think I want to fix anything, as I don't think I like who they have grown to become as people - deep down I would love to confront D and T but am trying to be in my chill girl era and handle everything as gracefully as I can.\n\nThoughts? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "AmIOverreacting"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

May just be answering my own question here but from what I now understand, all income whilst in Japan even from outside the country is taxed at the 20.42% rate - would that include this leave payment?

Or what about if the gigs were unpaid/just for fun at private events etc. (no alcohol sales)?

Not the plot, but the characters and why they behaved the way they did. I chalked this up to me not being smart enough to understand what the characters were trying to say. But upon today\u2019s rewatch, I\u2019ve realised that the characters themselves don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re trying to say. They\u2019re just angry \u2018without a cause\u2019. The context for this film\u2019s instant success is that it was perhaps the first films to show teenagers as troubled individuals that had pain and heartbreak and couldn\u2019t stand their parents, even if their parents were \u2018nice\u2019. In a way, it validated all their teenage angst while also shoving two extremely attractive leads, one of them, a heartthrob who had just died tragically and had become an everlasting symbol of youthful rebellion.\n\nA film that attempts to take the outbursts of teenagers seriously and portray them as fully-fledged characters. On paper, this film looks excellent; I just wish it held up under scrutiny. The plot is utterly nonsensical, the characters themselves aren\u2019t consistent, and the examples of \u2018bad parenting\u2019 are extremely dubious. On top of that, the acting and dialogue is very overdramatic and melodramatic in a way that doesn\u2019t enhance the film. I\u2019m aware that Nicholas Ray\u2019s films tend to be \u2018bigger than life\u2019 (if you\u2019ll pardon the pun), but I reckon the film\u2019s message could have been enhanced by more realism. I actually loved *Bigger Than Life*, precisely because it was so overdramatic, which made it more entertaining, but the same effect wasn\u2019t achieved here.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the parents. Throughout the film, we\u2019re given examples of how the parents supposedly don\u2019t give their children what they need. In Jim\u2019s case, he\u2019s resentful that his father kowtows to his mother and behaves in a \u2018feminine\u2019 way. A particularly galling scene shows Jim mad at his father for \u2018not standing up for himself\u2019 and cleaning a mess off the floor while wearing a dainty floral apron. To me, all of this behaviour was actually a sign that Jim\u2019s father is actually very comfortable in his masculinity, and able to perform tasks that women would traditionally do. It\u2019s actually rather progressive parenting, but it causes Jim to lash out and act out. I\u2019m not even sure where Jim was supposed to get the sense that his dad isn\u2019t a manly man\u2026 perhaps by watching John Wayne films? If this is the point that Nicholas Ray is trying to make, that stoic masculine types in films are preventing teenage boys from feeling like it\u2019s acceptable to show emotion, then he\u2019s doing it in a pretty roundabout way. I actually felt a kinship with the dad character, who seemed like the best-written character in the film, although he was a bit dim when Jim asked him what he would do if there was a dangerous situation he needed to attend in order to keep his honour; *NO!* Of course that\u2019s not a hypothetical situation, Dad!\n\nThen there\u2019s Judy, who seems to love her dad and hate her mum. I don\u2019t quite see why she hates her tolerant mother, and I also don\u2019t see why she\u2019s so shocked when the dad no longer feels comfortable with her kissing him, which she tries to force a second time, resulting in a slap. I don\u2019t get why he\u2019s uncomfortable with it either, though\u2026 maybe cos he sees his daughter as too grown up to kiss him? But that\u2019s literally all we see of them.\n\nLet\u2019s come to the central event of the film, the \u2018chicken race\u2019. I think it\u2019s pretty daft to present this as some kind of normal fare for teens of the day, but whatever, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s exciting for moviegoers to watch. The cinematography was pretty cool, with Natalie Wood waving the cars off just like *The Fast and the Furious*, but then Buzz actually dies. You\u2019d think Judy would be traumatised by this, but for the rest of the film, she actually seems to forget all about Buzz as she now has the hots for Jim. If I\u2019m supposed to believe in these characters, I\u2019d like to see them get a bit more torn up about this. It was shocking to see them playing together and having fun in the wake of the death of her boyfriend.\n\nThen there\u2019s Plato\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what to say. He\u2019s repressed and gay and is looked after by a nanny at his age. I guess that\u2019s why he\u2019s so messed up. It\u2019s well-known that the \u201cYou\u2019re tearing me apart!\u201d line directly influenced *The Room* and I\u2019m quite sure the wide-eyed, childlike Plato directly influenced Denny from that film. Useless and annoying.\n\nThe very final line of the film is shared by Jim\u2019s parents: after he introduces Judy to them, the dad says \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026\u201d and the mum says \u201cI\u2026\u201d and they both stop, look at each other and smile, before the camera pans out. I have absolutely no idea what this is supposed to mean, and would appreciate some theories or insight. Just a further example of how much of this was lost on me.\n\nI wish I had nicer things to say. I wanted to love this film, as I like all the actors and the director, but this is an utter mess of a film. Like the characters, it seems to be trying to say something but it\u2019s not quite sure what. Perhaps it was the first incarnation of those coming-of-age films that would be perfected by the time [*The Breakfast Club*](https://basilfilm.wordpress.com/2023/07/13/discussion-260-the-breakfast-club-1985/) came around. I will say it\u2019s a fascinating cultural document of the time, but it has aged dismally. Eerily, all three lead actors died at tragically young ages - Dean at 24, Wood at 43 and Mineo at 37 - which has only helped make the film more iconic. I just wish it lived up to its notoriety.\n\n3/10", "subreddit": "1001Movies"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

The detail, historical accuracy, combination of RTS and first person, etc. But I'm really struggling with how to manage large forces in some of the campaign missions.\n\nTo take as an example, the Ace of Swords German campaign mission at Kursk. I spent 20 minutes at 1/4 team organizing my forces into four groups of infantry with hotkeys, then running them over to the trucks to grab smoke grenades and dynamite charges, setting up my mortars, repairing the broken tank.\n\nThen when the time to attack comes, I have two groups advance down the road towards the first line of trenches under a smoke screen. I also have the repaired Panzer 3 move up a little bit to provide covering fire if possible. Under the smoke, I dynamite the obstacle, and have the mortars drop smoke rounds onto the first line of trenches before running the infantry in to clear them out.\n\nBut wait, now I'm taking fire from the right by an entrenched tank and some machine gun positions. Fine, I advance my other two squads in that direction to take it out. But uh oh, the Panzer 3 from above got a little too close and has now apparently been knocked out while I was dealing with the right flank. And oh no now I need to pivot one of my squads from the first assault to the left to take out a machine gun battery that's now shooting from the left, and I ordered one squad to move up the trenches to flank and take out the big AT emplacement. \n\nBy this time, I look to the right to see that an entire squad has now been taken out by a mortar shell because I didn't tell each individual soldier where to go and they all bunched in the trench. \n\n  \nAnd on and on and on. I just can't micromanage every unit and tell them what to do at every single moment. How do people organize their forces so that they can get things done without having to react to every little thing that happens personally. It's just exhausting and frustrating. The moment I turn my attention away from one area, I come back to see they've been annihilated by mortar rounds or a hidden artillery position while I was dealing with something else out of view.", "subreddit": "GatesOfHellOstfront"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

Also tried to be very careful about getting compat patches for everything that needed it.     \n\nThe only thing is I have been guilty of using LOOT and not manually sorting my LO, which I know is bad. But I've had no major issues with it till now. I posted in a modding Discord and they basically told me that I was a terrible person for downloading mods this way and it was an \"Average case of clueless new user with zero idea of what they're doing immediately going to the most popular page and downloading everything\".        \n\n\nThey really didn't provide anything helpful other than the [The Method](https://moddinglinked.com/themethod.html), which seems to be for when you are building a list from the ground up, not when you already have an existing save and list.     \nI did download XEdit and it's evident there are conflicts/overrides with the NewVegasMedicalClinicInt cell, but I have no idea how to go about resolving them. Feeling a little lost. Like I said the rest of the game has worked more or less flawlessly with great performance and all mods working as intended.      \n\nOnce again, I tried to be careful about how I download and what I download for this save, but it's evident I made some missteps like not manually sorting my load order (I may have also had Lone Star and JSUE and it's patches installed simultaneously as I didn't realize they were the same thing, but that has now been resolved).     \nWondering if anyone can help me figure this out and maybe even give me some pointers on how to better manually sort my load order. And please, if you're gonna be an asshole about things please just don't bother making a comment.    \nI'm just an average guy trying to replay FNV for nostalgia's sake, and don't know much about how to mod correctly but want to learn. If possible I'd really like to continue this playthrough and not have to start over as I'm having so much fun with it.      \nRelevant info:      \nCrash is reproducible, always happens after about ~2 secs of the loading screen while entering the clinic. The things that edit or add to the cell in my game are Delilah's quest (which is currently active), The Living Desert (adds some Followers Doctors to the clinic), Boom to the Moon (adds an NPC doctor), and apparently Skidge's Quest Pack.

I know you used to spend time with him a lot trying to help him.  And when he hit his head and lost his memory with you guys, or at least very vague memories, I know that had to have been painful too.  I feel like this is my fault\u2026\n\n\nMolly: What?!  No it\u2019s not.\n\n\nAdia: I allowed him to do something dangerous!  He never wanted to explore for so long because he was scared that something would\u2019ve happened to him.\n\n\nMolly: (whimpering) No, if anything, I feel like it was my fault.  I was pretty reckless myself and I think some of that rubbed off on him, even after he lost his memory.\n\n\nDarryl: Oh stop you 2!  It\u2019s neither of your faults!  This was just some extremely bad luck.  Stuff like this unfortunately happens, even to trained people.  He also just did hang gliding, something fun people do on vacation.  He didn\u2019t do any risky daredevil stuff, like jumping over a volcano in a motorbike, so don\u2019t feel bad about him trying to have something fun when it isn\u2019t extremely dangerous.  Besides, I don\u2019t think he wants you guys to blame yourselves over something you had basically no control over.\n\n\nMolly: \u2026Yeah, you\u2019re right Darryl.  Still\u2026 I wish he didn\u2019t die\u2026\n\n\nAdia: (sniffling) He was my childhood friend too\u2026 I didn\u2019t think he would die less than a year after we reunited\u2026\n\n\nMolly: (whimpering) Yeah and we spent a lot of time together in Brighton; with me trying to enhappify him and-  I\u2019m sorry, could you leave us alone please?\n\n\nThey do just that and exit Adia\u2019s room.

Also I\u2019m i pressed with you for what you said back there Darryl.  First time I heard you give some words of wisdom.\n\n\nDarryl: Yeah, well it\u2019s true.

Why don\u2019t you move to Brighton?\n\n\nAdia: No offense Molly, but I like staying here.  All my other friends are here and going back to Brighton will only keep reminding me of him.\n\n\nMolly: Understood, I would hate to leave Brighton too.  Already had to move away from countless other places\u2026\n\n\nAdia: Oh I\u2019m sorry to hear.\n\n\nMolly: It\u2019s alright.\n\n\nAdia: I also don\u2019t want to go outside of my home in general\u2026\n\n\nMolly: Why not?\n\n\nAdia: Molly, I almost died that day.  I don\u2019t want to risk dying again anytime soon.  I just feel safer staying at home.  Possibly for the rest of my life.\n\n\nMolly: Miss. Williams, don\u2019t talk like that.  You sound just like how Todd used to sound.  Now granted this is different: This is from ptsd rather than just solely anxiety, but please, PLEASE consider seeking out a therapist.\n\n\nAdia: (sigh) Alright, I\u2019ll consider it\u2026\n\n\nMolly: Thank you.\n\n\nAdia: And thank you for coming all the way here just for me.\n\n\nMolly: No problem.  I should get going now, but I\u2019ll make sure to keep visiting you.  \n\n\nAdia: No you don\u2019t have to do that.  I\u2019ll keep in touch with letters like we always did.\n\n\nMolly: Okay. But you could still use the company, cuz it seemed like you were secluding yourself.  Maybe invite your friends over more often.  \n\n\nAdia: Alright, I\u2019ll do that.\n\n\nMolly: Thank you.

{"post": {"title": "Apollo Justice, Yet Another New Player Reacts (Spoilers)", "id": "1i31c2y", "created_utc": 1737066781.0, "selftext": "I recently finished Apollo Justice. I've enjoyed reading some other reactions here and wanted to share mine.\n\n\\>!I went into this game severely spoiled for AJ1, and mildly spoiled for DD and SoJ. When I finished the original AA trilogy, AJ was not out on Switch, my only gaming system, and I wasn't hardcore enough to search out other ways to play. But because I really liked the stories, I read a decent chunk of fanfic. (There's some great stuff out there!) Through fanfic, I became intensely curious about how I would see disbarment and Phoenix in general in AJ1. Was this really a 7-year bluff? Was Phoenix really a borderline alcoholic neglectful father? How many ethical lines did he cross and why?\n\nBut to complicate things, I played some of this game (the first three cases and a bit of the fourth) in a language I'm learning (Korean.) Between stuff I didn't entirely understand, stuff where I basically understood but may have missed emotional nuance, and stuff that's actually different, that may have given me a slightly different experience than if I played 100% in English.\n\n**Turnabout Trump:** very fun case! This sets up the key mystery of the game: what the heck happened to Phoenix Wright? Why is he acting like this? How did he get disbarred? I did lose out on Kristoph's reveal, obviously, but it was still a creepy situation.\n\n**Turnabout Corner:** another fun case! I loved seeing a grouchy Apollo scrounge around for multiple trivial situations, only to end up handling a murder. Trucy was an immediate delight and when she first brought out Mr. Hat, I just about died laughing. But my favorite moment of all was when Eldoon took off his crazy noodle hat and was moved to tears that someone still needed his opinion as a doctor... and dropped some intense truths about Wocky's situation.\n\nIt seemed obvious to me that Phoenix was deliberately giving off mixed signals, messing with Apollo to hook his curiosity. In one breath he says he's broke and he and Trucy team up to spin this big sob story, in another he's like, yeah I impulse bought a bunch of DVD's. He's in-patient at a hospital but he looks pretty lively and only complains about his ankle... and isn't using crutches. I'm inclined to think the truth was probably somewhere in the middle. I doubt Phoenix was rich enough to afford a hospital staycation, and even if like Edgeworth or somebody helped with medical bills, I doubt they'd do it for no reason. So I suspect he was downplaying his injuries. Phoenix also had a smile on his face the whole time, but all I could think about was how Mia raised him to put on his biggest smile during the hardest moments.\n\n**Turnabout Serenade:** such a mixed bag. In character terms I thought this was great. Apollo-Trucy bonding, Ema and Trucy teaming up to tease Apollo, Ema being upset that she failed to prevent a murder, and especially Klavier showing so many facets of himself. He's a charmer to Trucy, he's unfair enough to immediately blame Apollo for somehow lighting the guitar on fire, but fair enough to get himself in check and apologize. He's an ass to Daryan, humiliating the guy by pulling outsiders (both Trucy and Apollo) into a discussion over a missed cue. He's narcissistic enough so that somebody getting murdered seems no more important that losing his keys--but to be fair that's in part because he correctly believes his keys got stolen, which ends up interwoven with the murder case. In short, he's a perfectionist. And yet once again, he pulls back from his own faults, makes sure to share all his info with Apollo, and talks about his commitment to the truth, not win rate or ego.\n\nBut ugh the case was frustrating. The prosecution's arguments were so... ugh! \"We know the culprit was blind because only a blind person could miss a shot.\" Nonsense like that, over and over. At first it felt like Klavier knew the case was BS and went so far as to warn Apollo before they even met in court. I thought, well, he has to follow orders and he's just doing his best. But at some point it felt like Klavier bought into his own BS arguments. I guess I have to cut him slack, because suspecting Daryan probably took quite a toll. Plus some of the mini games just didn't do it for me like, at all.\n\nAs for Phoenix, he mostly wasn't present but he gave Apollo genuinely good advice in the lobby. To this point, it seemed to me that Phoenix wasn't ready to confide in Apollo, so he was keeping his distance while still trying to mentor him from afar.\n\n**Turnabout Succession:** fantastic finale to a fantastic game! I liked each section. The Mason system just made no sense whatsoever... like is the jury really supposed to be playing this video game? One which reveals info that Apollo himself never even finds out? It's just weird, but it was fun to use, providing a neat and tidy way to let the player find out a ton of information about a lot of topics.\n\nFinally, finally I found out what happened to Phoenix. And if I hadn't already figured out how much pain and bitterness lay behind those smiles, the final case really made it clear. The way he just shut down when the judge concluded he was a forger... there was such a heaviness to that scene.\n\nThe one weak leg was Apollo's final appearance in court. That section dragged, with all the good stuff having been revealed by Mason. I also wish that Apollo got featured as POV character in the after-the-case content.\n\n**Original Reception:** One thing I've read is this game nearly sank the Ace Attorney franchise, and oddly, even though I absolutely loved the game, I can actually see that. I think the game benefits from history, because knowing with 100% certainty that Phoenix Wright ends up okay, gets his badge back and goes on to more awesome stories, makes this game a lot easier to like. Despite being warned, it was honestly such a shock to see Phoenix looking so ragged, and I don't mean stubble and a homemade hat. It was the way his eyes would just glaze over. We wait so long to find out what happened, I think if I hadn't been spoiled, I might have judged Turnabout Succession much more harshly just because of the weight of worry I'd have built up before playing it.\n\n**Ema:** I heard she was such an ass, but mostly she just made me laugh. Like so many AA characters, she's an amusingly annoying person who will both help and obstruct. But honestly, when she obstructed (and acted rude), it seemed like she thought it was her job. I don't think she should have blocked Apollo from that first crime scene, but I guess in the dark age of the law there's so much concern about tampering that she felt it was her duty? Anyway, to me Ema came across as a fun person with a bit of a dickish sense of humor.\n\n**Phoenix, presenting the card:** people say he was such an arrogant ass but I didn't really see it. He was anxious because he didn't have time to prepare, anxious because he knew Zak was keeping secrets, even anxious because he heard Klavier was the new hot-shot prosecutor. Most of the stuff about Klavier's inexperience was inside his own head. Klavier for his part was grandstanding a fair bit and Phoenix eventually made one mild trash-talk comment in response. When Klavier flipped out and called Phoenix an arrogant fraud, I don't think it was because of that one mild comment. I think it's because Klavier was genuinely, truly broken up at his belief that Phoenix was regularly forging evidence.\n\n**Phoenix as Dad:** I want to believe he was a good dad because I love the guy but... canon doesn't really show it. I know many fans say that \"grape juice\" is really grape juice, but there's so much deliberately evocative stuff like changing the labels, Trucy telling him the doctors told him to drink less, etc... Then there's stuff like Trucy being the agency's primary income and also the manager, and also hanging at the bar with him evening after evening to help him win at poker.  I wish he'd been shown in a better light as a parent. At least the moment when he talks about how he's the only one who can see how Trucy really feels, when she hides her feelings so well, was really poignant.\n\n**Phoenix as Mentor:** well, he never apologized for the forged card, but he did coach Apollo, if only for a distance. By having Apollo take down Klavier, he cleared Apollo from any suspicion of involvement or knowledge about Klavier's crimes. I don't think he was completely terrible as a mentor.\n\n**Apollo being overshadowed in his own game:** kind of? I didn't mind, because Apollo was a cool character, I got to play him a solid amount, and I thought the game was really fun. The core story was really about Phoenix and disbarment, but that mostly worked for me.\n\n**Thalassa on the jury:** honestly Phoenix stacking the jury bugs me a LOT more than forging the card. If I had to choose between going to jail for murder or forging evidence, well I don't have the skills so I'd be out of luck, but my point is I'm not going to judge Phoenix harshly for that, not given that he'd tried for seven long years to take Kristoph down and just kept failing. But stacking the jury was so unnecessary and pretty messed up.\n\nAnyway I've gone on long enough, but I enjoyed the chance to write out my thoughts because, like I said, I've enjoyed reading everyone else's.!<", "subreddit": "AceAttorney"}, "sentiment": "negative"}
{"post": {"title": "Housing warning and rant", "id": "1i31c0g", "created_utc": 1737066775.0, "selftext": "I guess I don't need to explain that housing in Madrid is a nightmare. We arrived here as a couple, so we were looking for a studio. With our aux carta, most of the housing options were not available for us, because all places prefer people with long term goals and an indefinite contract.\n\nWe agreed to a small studio, convenient location with an agency, specialized in short- and midterm rentals. One month deposit, one month agency fee, the contract seemed legit, the people were nice. \n\nFirst red flag was that they were trying to rush us about signing the lease by sending as WhatsApp messages during the weekend, saying there are more people, who are interested, and they cannot wait for us, unless we pay the agency fee in advance.  We did not pay until we had the contract and the keys, and everything was nice and clean. We were happy to move in. \n\nFirst issue: WIFI, they made us pay 40\u20ac for the wifi,   every months, which was shared with the entire floor, so at least 5 flats. In the evenings, when everyone was home, trying to work and study, it was unusable. It took several weeks, arguments and screenshots of the download speed (under 2 Mbps) to actually get a semi-solution. A repeater drilled into the kitchen counter.\n\nThen winter arrived, and with the heating on, new problems appeared. The electric network shuts down at least 6 times every day. The agency decided to fill the flat with only electric appliances, and they were the ones who specifically told us on our first visit, that there is no problem with the system, they even showed us the electric closet with the circuit breakers, which really seemed to cover our consumption. \n\nWhen we first told them about the problem, the answer was a kind 'we will look into it'. After several days of nothing, we wrote again. They said nobody has ever had a problem like this, we are using too much electricity. So we started to talk to our neighbours, we found out that the whole block of flats is suffering from daily power shortages, an elderly lady who has been living here for more than 8 years specifically told us that the problem started when the agency bought the bigger flats, and divided them into small studios. \n\nSo even though we had proof that the problem existed before us, they continued with the gaslighting, that it is our fault, and we should reduce our consumption. Reduce? How? We should not cook or heat?\n\nDuring Christmas break we travelled home and turned down the electricity in the whole flat. A day later we got a message, that the agency wants to go into our flat to 'examine' the problem. As we were hoping to get this sorted out, while we are away, we gave them permission to enter. We arrived back, but nothing has changed. \n\nWe have been complaining regularly, and today they told us, that we should discuss the consumption with our neighbours, as we share the circuit. \n\nOn our first visit we were told that the circuit and the electricity panel is for our flat specifically. So according to this new information, they wanted to enter the flat, to switch back the electric network, as the neighbours didn't have any because of us. They never intended to solve the problem of which they were clearly aware, and they were trying to put all the blame on us. \n\nThere are small nuances, which we weren't aware at our first visit.\n1) There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom, so all the steam reaches the not-so-good-quality wood ceiling, which supports the gallery serving as the bedroom.\n2) if you close the bathroom door, you cannot open the shower\n3) the sliding door broke after a month, and it took them two weeks to repair, so we weren't able to close the door for two weeks\n4) the walls are so thin, that you can hear everything, even when the neighbours are whispering \n5) the closet door broke as well in November, they still haven't repaired it\n6) there is mold in the bathroom and in the living room area due to the lack if proper ventilation \n\nI guess my main problem is not that this is a tiny overpriced whole in Madrid, but the attitude that the agency has towards the issues which we are facing. The constant gaslighting and the pretentious politeness without any actual help.\n\nFun fact, the agency changes its name every once in a while, so new tenants cannot find the negative feedbacks on their goole review, and they also threaten previous tenants about not giving their deposit back, if they don't leave a 5* review. \n\nRight now we are not in the position to pay 2 months deposit and 1 months agency fee for a new apartment, so we stuck here until the end of the contract. This is a rant about my frustration and a warning, that if you find an agency which seems too young or the reviews are ambivalent, than save yourself and don't get involved.", "subreddit": "SpainAuxiliares"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

(i\u2019m sure you hear a lot of 18 year olds say this, but that\u2019s gonna be my husband. even our parents know. we will be together 2 years on the 23rd this month) however, even with his support and my new motivation i just kept slipping though, i would work so hard and then this feeling would come over me, like i had to stop immediately. i was done. then i would eventually get back to work, i ended up graduating high school 1 month after the rest of my class but i did it. then, my boyfriend decided to go to a d2 school just for me. he had a million d1 offers for his sport, but with my high school transcript i couldn\u2019t make it there with him, so he went to that first college with me. then, i worked harder and got into the d1 school he wanted to go to. \n\nnow, he\u2019s there and i am doing online classes from home right now. i am waiting until they get me a single dorm (disability accommodations), i took my oldest niece (8f) from my sisters house and she\u2019s staying with me in my room right now, she\u2019s struggling really hard. i see myself in her, except she\u2019s a bit different. i dont think she feels empathy, it\u2019s really strange to watch. she will intentionally harm someone, and smile. it almost warms her heart? i don\u2019t know. i don\u2019t know anything anymore, i take care of her the best i can. when my sister had her at 18, i was 10 and i took her. i moved her crib into my room, i spent the rough nights with her in her new born stage, im the only one who knows how to do her braids (she is black, we are all white), i\u2019m in the process of re-braiding right now.\n\ni\u2019m so worried for my niece, my mom, my brother is struggling, my sister is struggling, i want to stay home and take care of them and keep helping and clean and take the kids but am i horrible?? because i actually don\u2019t want that at all, i want to forget it all. it feels so horrible to say that, i want to go to college and get away from all of it and pretend it\u2019s not my problem. \n\ni need money, i need to get my niece a phone so she can call me any time, i need to pay for my own food (having ARFID, eating is extremely difficult for me, it needs to be food i am okay with) but i just can\u2019t work. i am doing all my classes online, so i could work but my body doesn\u2019t wanna move. i\u2019ve had jobs before, and when i\u2019m in some sort of episode i can hear my brain screaming and the screaming is so loud. i don\u2019t even have a license, i can\u2019t drive. i was scared of driving for the longest time and i still am, but even if i wasn\u2019t i don\u2019t have a car to get my license with. \n\ni don\u2019t work, i don\u2019t drive, i don\u2019t have bills right now, and all i want to do is get away from my life and go to school. that makes me feel lazy & like a piece of shit, what do i have to be stressed out about?? i cant even imagine what some of you are going through, why am i like this? i want so badly to go to parties. i want to be that girl that sticks her head out the window of a car with sunglasses on or something. i want to get drunk. (i don\u2019t drink due to ARFID) i want to be a crazy stupid college girl, i wanna be blonde or something. i want to go to my classes and be awesome, i want to have a job and a car that i can annoyingly jangle the keys to. i want to drink starbucks and not care who the company is. i just don\u2019t do any of that though. i sit in my room, i worry, i do my school work, i take care of the kids, i hang out with my mom, i play video games with my boyfriend. i\u2019ve never been to a party, too many germs, too loud, drunk people, bad things happen at parties. \n\ni love my classes, i am going to be a fashion designer. it\u2019s what i\u2019ve always wanted, and i just love being a student now that i\u2019m out of high school. i want to know how to make money from home, on my phone or my laptop. doesn\u2019t anyone know of completely online jobs? pretty sure my oldest niece is a sociopath or something, y\u2019all should see her little smile when she knows someone is hurt because of her. she really is my sweet girl, i love her so much how do i fix her brain? i have 2 nieces and 3 nephews and i am not joking they\u2019re all pretty messed up in some way. i don\u2019t know how to help my sister. i am pretty sure my brain is exploding or something i\u2019m not sure. i need to focus on getting an online job, i am terrified of the Norovirus (emetophobia, extremely severe. that\u2019s how i developed ARFID. if i feel as if i could be sick i will stop eating for days, i try not to leave the house when that goes around.) \n\ni will stop rambling- to sum it up:\n\u2022 entirely online jobs?\n\u2022 why am i like this\n\u2022 do you think i\u2019m lazy\n\u2022 how do i help my niece \n\u2022 how do i function \n\u2022 help\n\nthank you if you read this thank you so so much\n", "subreddit": "offmychest"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

I was so proud of myself that I spent all of 2024 without speaking to him. He would call me every 2 to 3 months in the late hours of the night, and I would ignore him. I was focusing on myself and what made me happy, and I had achieved great peace in my life.\n\nThis past New Year's Eve, he calls me again at around 3 am. I did not pick up. He messaged me saying I miss you and the next day he said Happy New Year. I said Happy New Year back, thinking I could keep things cordial. We do though end up having a phone conversation, where I find out he was with his child, ex, and her family when he called me on New Year's Eve. He said he was calling to check up on me. He later asks me to hang out and try to have fun without focusing on the past. I said no, I cannot have fun with you, if you want to speak about the issues we can, but I'm not going to ignore them.

To say he can't commit to anything. To the grand finale: admitting he is still in love with his ex and becoming stone-cold towards me. Basically, he said that he wishes he could get back with his ex, but she doesn't want anything to do with him outside of co-parenting. He thought it was okay to call me because I was the only one he could talk to. Oh, what an honor.\n\nImmediately I feel betrayed, manipulated, and used. He made it seem like he was willing to work on things with me so that in exchange I would give him emotional support. The minute I demanded real actions, he folded and revealed his true intentions. I am crushed. In such a short week, he has taken away from my peace and brought instead chaos and dysfunction.

And it was surprising of how mucch he matured. He had great banter with Lerix, while not ever pushing too hard. He didnt ever take over or disrupt stream, which I feel was what annoyed Lerix about Smaggle in the past. This was even noticed by Lerix when he retardedly paused and went on a long rant about what Dream should say, and Smaggle told him that he is about to say it. Lerix was waiting for Smaggle to call him a pause andy or make fun of him but Smaggle didnt take advantage of the situation, showing great temperance.\n\nSmaggle has said that hes been working behind the scenes lately and that is likely the reason hes been less active in Lerixs streams. He has likely been working for other streamers collecting research for $$$. If Lerix incentived Smaggle with a part time salary (for example: 15% of donos when he appears) then he would obviously come on more to the viewers delight.  Lerix should really consider this because Smaggle brings an element to the streams rhat no one else can. Also, having Smaggle on will make Lerix look like a greatly articulate orator because his frequent mispronunciations and using words incorrectly will be shadowed by Smaggles unfortunate speech impediment that gives him an automatic disadvantage whatever the case. \n\nSmaggle for cohost 2025.

I guess it's natural!\n\nMy procedure was scheduled for 1/16 at 7am, had to arrive at 4:45 (showering with the special soap at 3:30am wasn't fun but whatever haha). Check in and everything ahead of the surgery went smoothly, everyone was super nice and helpful.\n\nI was supposed to get a uterine ablation as well, but I wasn't able to get it done because apparently my uterine cavity was too narrow. I didn't know that could happen, but I guess if it were going to be risky I'm happy the surgeon didn't go through with it. I'm hoping now I also have an easier time fighting the bill since everything should be preventative. During registration they said I would owe $4000, so planning on fighting that over the next few weeks.\n\nI woke up in a good amount of pain, and feeling like I really had to pee. But when I tried only a little came out, so I think it was just a weird reaction to anesthesia. They gave me some pain meds and pretty quickly I was told to change and was brought to my car. One thing that wasn't ideal is that I never got to talk to my surgeon afterward, she only talked to my finance over the phone from the waiting room as soon as I was done. But she mentioned we can talk about some other options for stopping my periods during our post op appointment.\n\nAnyway, the issue now is that I'm in pain, but CVS was out of stock of the pain meds that were called in for me. I'm trying to get it transferred to another one, or get another medicine prescribed, but I'm having trouble reaching my doctor / anyone from the team. I'm sure she's busy with other patients but it's really unfortunate, as it's looking like I won't be able to get them today.\n\nI'm not supposed to take any advil / nsaids, so that only leaves tylenol, which isn't very strong. Has anyone else only used tylenol and managed the pain okay? Is the first night / second day really bad? Any other tips to minimize the pain in the stomach area?\n\nOverall I'm happy that this is done but I would feel a lot better if I had my medicine!", "subreddit": "sterilization"}, "sentiment": "negative"}

{"post": {"title": "Is my (31F) relationship with my bf (45M) worth saving? ", "id": "1i3177f", "created_utc": 1737066424.0, "selftext": "I (31F) have struggled with relationships my whole life. I tend to people-please and stay in unhealthy situations because I believe nobody is perfect and some people deserve second chances. I also have trust issues from witnessing cheating and manipulation between my parents. A few months ago, I started dating my boyfriend (45M). While I was initially drawn to his positive, fun attitude, I later found out he\u2019s been messaging women online, which I consider cheating. When I confronted him, at first he dismissed it saying it\u2019s not cheating because it\u2019s not in person and he doesn\u2019t love them but now he says he has done nothing wrong. I asked to look at his phone and he would only let me look for about a second before he ripped it out of my hands. I asked him to unfollow certain accounts on instagram a few times but he hasnt. I broke up with him and he came back asking how he can make it better. I told him that the only way I could build trust with him is if he shares his location with me since I felt like he was lying about what he was up to. He did for 24 hours then shut it off. He also says things to me, like I don\u2019t deserve him, I need help, he\u2019s never seen a women have these issues I have and I\u2019m insecure. I know it\u2019s wrong, but deep down, I feel like I am those things so I keep letting him back in. He does things for me, but emotionally, I feel neglected. He never asks about me, only talks about himself, and when I voice concerns, he doesn\u2019t listen. I love him, he sticks by me with my many flaws and in some weird way I feel at home with him, but we\u2019re stuck in a cycle and nothing changes. I\u2019m so tired of trying to explain myself, he literally does not take anything I say into consideration. There a moments where he will let me talk but it\u2019s like he has amnesia and forgets the whole conversation and it\u2019s back to he\u2019s done nothing wrong and I\u2019m impossible to make happy. I\u2019ve tried therapy, but it\u2019s too expensive, and work has left me physically and emotionally drained. Despite having a strong support system, I feel exhausted and sad. I don\u2019t know if I can trust him, and I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ll never find someone who isn\u2019t focused on other women online or cheating. If anyone could offer any advice or suggestions that have helped them find happiness or if this is even salvageable. Thank you very much", "subreddit": "Codependency"}, "sentiment": "negative"}
